OF THE TEAM</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<small>A HERO RETURNS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two boys met in the Grand Central Station
in New York one warm afternoon in late
September and, greeting each other, passed
hurriedly toward the gate beyond which the
Hartford Express waited. Each was good-looking,
well-built, alert and self-possessed. But a few
months separated their ages, although Jack Brewton
had seen his eighteenth birthday and Stuart
Harven had not. In the train, their bags at their
feet, they plunged into conversation. While they
had been close friends at Manning School, they had
not met during vacation, nor had they corresponded.
At seventeen and eighteen one is far too
busy for letter writing, and, fortunately, friendship
doesn’t demand it. There was, consequently, much
to be said, and the journey to Safford was half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
over before the subject of summer adventures had
been exhausted. Then Stuart gave the talk a new
turn with the careless announcement:</p>

<p>“I had a letter from the new coach about a month
ago.”</p>

<p>“Haynes?” asked Jack interestedly. “What did
he have to say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. Said he thought he ought to
get in touch with me and hoped I was having a
pleasant vacation and all that. Suggested my meeting
him in New York and talking things over, but
I couldn’t make it. The date he set was just the
time we were starting off on the cruise.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. What’s the good of talk?
There wasn’t anything to be done until we got the
team together. I hope to goodness he isn’t going to
be one of the talky kind: his letter looked that way:
he wrote about four pages, I guess. Said he hoped
I was keeping in good condition and wasn’t neglecting
kicking.” Stuart chuckled. “I haven’t touched
a football but once since spring practice. Then we
had a sort of a game up at the camp one day. A
lot of the college chaps were football men: Means of
Cornell, and Davis of Dartmouth, and five or six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
others. We had quite a scrappy little game.
Played two twenty-minute periods. Of course the
counselors won, but they had to work for it. I
played quarter and got off two dandy runs, one for
nearly seventy yards.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have put in some practice, just the
same, Stuart,” said Jack disapprovingly. “It
wouldn’t have done any harm.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been at it pretty steadily for the last
month.”</p>

<p>“Faithful old Fido!” laughed Stuart. “Well, I
don’t believe in it. A fellow comes back much fitter
and more ready for work if he doesn’t wear himself
out during the summer. I don’t think it hurts you
any, for you’re a shark for work, and always were,
but I get stale if I overdo it. Bet you I’ll show
more pep to-morrow than the fellows who have been
summer training.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Jack, smiling but unconvinced.
“Still, pep isn’t everything. I’ll bet you
can’t kick five goals out of ten tries from the thirty-yard
line to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” laughed Stuart. “I’ll be able to
next week. Look here, what’s the good of bringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the team back five days before term opens if they’re
going to know it all before they come? That’s what
the early session’s for, to get us back in shape.”</p>

<p>“We ought to be in shape when we get back,”
answered Jack. “We can’t afford to give Pearsall
even one day’s start of us, Stuart.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about Pearsall this year,” replied
the other, smiling and confident. “We’re going
to do her up brown.”</p>

<p>“Hope so.”</p>

<p>“Sure to! At least, we will if Haynes turns
out all right. I’m still wishing, though, we’d gone
after Corcoran.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of wishing it?” asked Jack, with
a shrug. “You know we couldn’t have paid his
price. Take my advice, old son: forget Corcoran
and make the best of ‘Hop’ Haynes. Anyhow,
Stuart, don’t start out with a prejudice toward
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got nothing against the man. I dare
say he will do well enough. Still, you know yourself,
Jack, he’s just a ‘small town’ coach: never did
anything big.”</p>

<p>“If he had Manning wouldn’t have got him,” replied
Jack. “He put in three successful years at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Fisherville, though, and was assistant at Erskine a
year before that.”</p>

<p>“Fisherville doesn’t play a team unless she knows
she can beat it. Any one could coach Fisherville to
win. Bet you I could myself!”</p>

<p>Jack smiled and shook his head. “You’re a great
little quarterback, Stuart, and you’re the youngest
captain Manning has ever had, and all that, but don’t
ever try coaching, old son. You couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” demanded Stuart.
“You don’t have to be a wonder to coach a football
team.”</p>

<p>“No, but you have to have one quality that you
haven’t, Stuart,” answered the other in good-humored
raillery.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Stuart suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Amenability,” replied Jack gravely.</p>

<p>“What’s amenability? You mean good nature?
Rot!”</p>

<p>“Look it up when you get a chance,” laughed
Jack. “Anyhow, you stick to captaining.”</p>

<p>“I believe I’ve been insulted, but no matter. Say,
I ran across a couple of nice-looking plays this
summer. They’re not new, of course, but we’ve
never used them and they might be good medicine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
for Pearsall. Got a piece of paper? An old letter
will do. That’s the ticket!” Stuart produced a
pencil and the two boys leaned their heads close
while it traced strange lines on the back of an
envelope.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the friends parted, Stuart
carrying his bag to Lacey Hall and Jack taking his
to Meigs. They were to meet later for supper in the
village; meals for the football candidates were to begin
with breakfast in Lyceum House to-morrow;
and meanwhile there were trunks to be unpacked.
Stuart’s room, on the second floor of Lacey, had
been prepared for his occupancy. One of the two
small beds was made up and the accumulated dust of
the summer had been removed. Stuart set his bag
on the table and looked about him. The room, with
its gray papered walls, its brown craftsman furniture,
its two-tone blue rug and its pictures and trophies,
was surprisingly like home, and he gave a sigh
of satisfaction as he threw aside his coat and went to
the end window. The sun had traveled past, and
when he raised the shade and the lower sash a cool
breeze entered, bringing with it a few dried ivy
leaves from the stone sill. Below him lay a narrow
strip of grass between the building and School Lane.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
The young maples that lined both sides of the way—the
lane had been cut through but four years ago—were
still green, but the leaves looked dry and tired,
as though the hot summer had been almost too much
for them. Across the graveled thoroughfare, seen
from the window between the upper branches of the
trees, was Memorial Building, the dining hall, its
buff sandstone front, with its four tall columns, hot
in the afternoon sunlight. Further to Stuart’s left
stood the library; beyond it, the tennis courts.
Straight ahead, the school grounds ended at an iron
fence half hidden by shrubbery and vines, and then
came an open field that descended to the placid,
winding river. The new steel bridge over which
High Street led was just visible past the corner of
Memorial. Beyond it, nestling ’neath tall elms,
spread the town. Two church spires, one slenderly
conical and one square and dignifiedly squatty,
pierced the greenery with their white forms, and
now and then a weathered gray roof or a red-brown
chimney peeked forth.</p>

<p>Safford was like half a hundred other Connecticut
towns, quiet, as placid as the river that flowed
around it and unvexed by the problems that beset
larger communities. Twice a day the express<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
paused for a moment at the little station and at four
other times local trains tarried on their way up and
down the valley. There were no street cars and,
speaking comparatively, even automobiles were
scarce. Safford’s only claim to renown was Manning
School; and there had been occasions—perhaps
there still are—when Safford’s inhabitants would
have been willing to worry along without such
fame. The celebrations of athletic victories occur
only infrequently, however, and for the most part
the townsfolk had no cause for complaint, and were
doubtless glad enough of the presence of the big
school across the river. I know the storekeepers
were, anyway.</p>

<p>Stuart’s trunk arrived before he had quite finished
washing off the dust of travel, and for nearly an
hour after that he busied himself unpacking, stowing
his things methodically away in drawers or
hanging them neatly in the closet, in the latter process
carefully taking up no more than his half of the
hooks. The occupant of the other bed and proprietor
of the second chiffonier would be along in a few
days, and there must be space for his belongings.
Neil Orr came from Stuart’s home city and represented
the reason why Stuart was remaining in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Lacey through his upper middle year instead of
moving to Meigs as was the privilege, almost invariably
taken advantage of, of the third-year students.
Neil was a lower middle class fellow, and since he
must remain in Lacey, Stuart had elected to remain
with him. To his own belief at least, Stuart had
acted as guide and protector to Neil during the previous
year and he couldn’t conceive of Neil’s getting
along without him. Perhaps he exaggerated his
usefulness to Neil somewhat, but the motives that
prompted him to forego life in the upper class dormitory
were wholly creditable.</p>

<p>It was still too early for supper when he had
finished his task and changed into a comfortable old
suit, and, probably because Neil was still in his
thoughts, he went down and crossed the old campus
to Holton Hall. The northern half of the school
property had become known as the old campus when
School Lane had been cut through. It held five
dormitories and Manning Hall, the latter accommodating
the recitation rooms, the assembly hall and
the offices. Of the five dormitories, Holton was the
elder brother and stood back from the rest as though
keeping a fraternal watch on them. Stuart was not
sure that his visit would prove successful, for there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
still remained four days before the faculty members
were required to report, but when he came within
sight of the corner study which was his destination
his doubts were removed. The two end windows on
the lower floor were wide open and the brown silk
sash curtains were pushed wide. Mr. Moffit, attired
principally in a pair of discolored gray flannel
trousers and a running shirt, was applying a piece of
emery cloth to the head of a lofter when Stuart, accepting
the invitation to enter, pushed the study door
wide. A golf bag leaned against the morris chair
at the instructor’s elbow, but it went to the floor with
a rattle and crash of its contents when Mr. Moffit
jumped up.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo, Harven!” he exclaimed in pleased surprise.
“So we’re back again! My, my, and all
browned up like a berry! Well, I am glad to see
you, my boy!” He shook hands with a grip that
made the visitor wince and pushed the latter toward
a chair. “You’ve found me in rather an undignified
moment, it seems. Suppose you take your own coat
off and lend me countenance. It’s been frightfully
hot here to-day.”</p>

<p>“Hot everywhere, sir. New York was like an
oven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“You came that way? Isn’t there a shorter route
from Springfield?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you have to change, sir. And I wired
Jack Brewton to meet me at the Grand Central.
Been playing golf, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite a lot this summer. But it’s over
with.” Mr. Moffit sighed. “Harven, I’m more
than ever convinced that the Destiny that shapes our
ends made a botch of it in my case. I ought to have
been born with a silver spoon. I’m naturally the
laziest man on earth except as to one thing. That’s
golf. I’ll toil from sunup to pitch dark playing
golf, but anything else—especially the teaching of
English—comes mighty hard. And this fall it
seems to me that I’m lazier than ever before. I
don’t want to go back into harness one earthly bit,
my boy. I sigh for wealth and slothfulness, for
silken shirts and shaded porches. The gods bestow
their favors blunderingly.”</p>

<p>“You’d soon get tired of silk shirts and porches,”
laughed Stuart. “I’m sure I would. Want some
help with those, sir?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but this is the last. I’m putting them to
bed for a nine months’ sleep. Unless—” the instructor’s
eyes brightened—“you play? There’s a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
very fair links over at Harrington, and I could
sneak in a couple of hours in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, sir. Besides, football begins to-morrow
and I suppose we’ll have two sessions a day until
Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“That’s why you’re back. I’d forgotten.” Mr.
Moffit slipped the lofter into the bag with a sigh.
“That reminds me that I met your new coach this
forenoon. He seems a very pleasant, affable sort,
but he doesn’t play golf. Have you met him
yet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Do you know where he’s staying?”</p>

<p>“He told me, but I’ve forgotten. I’m afraid I
lost interest when I found he was not a golfer.
Somewhere in the village, of course.”</p>

<p>“I thought of looking him up this evening, but if
I don’t know where he’s living I suppose I can’t do
it.”</p>

<p>“He’s probably taking his meals at the hotel. I
fancy you’d get a word of him there, Harven.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but there’s no hurry. I’ll see him in
the morning. Are there many of the team back, do
you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. You’re the first chap I’ve seen. No
one’s come yet, except Mr. Wallace and me, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
I know. Doctor Gurley’s back, of course. I took
dinner with him last evening. Vacation appears to
have toned him up remarkably. So it has you, my
boy. Have a pleasant summer?”</p>

<p>“Dandy, sir! You’re looking awfully fit, too.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Yes, I’m feeling fairly rugged,
thanks, but—but not at all ambitious! I purposely
came back a few days ahead to do some work. I’ve
got a new course to map out, for one thing. But all
I’ve done so far is clean five golf clubs!” And Mr.
Moffit looked with humorous sadness at the bag beside
him.</p>

<p>Stuart laughed. “Don’t you worry, sir. You’ll
soon be in form again and making things hard for
us as usual.”</p>

<p>Mr. Moffit smiled and shook his head. “I trust
that you are right, but to-day there’s no iron in my
make-up. I’m absolutely out of character and the
sorriest theme ever handed in by a junior couldn’t
move me to wrath! Well, you’ve come back to a
pretty stiff task, my boy, haven’t you? Do you
know, I’m not certain that I wouldn’t rather have
my own job than yours. If I make mistakes I can
remedy them or I can gloss them over, but if you
make them they’ll stand out on the football season<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
like so many sore thumbs, and you won’t have time
to remedy them. A bit awed by the responsibility,
are you?”</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head smilingly. “No, sir, I
don’t think so. Of course, it’s going to take some
work, but we’ve got a good crowd to start with. If
Mr. Haynes knows football as he’s supposed to,
things will run along all right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“The confidence of youth is a beautiful thing,”
murmured the other. “Well, I sincerely hope that
things will run along all right and I wish you the
best luck in the world. And that means a successful
season crowned by a glorious victory over
Pearsall. I’ll be watching with a great deal of interest
how the youngest captain ever elected here performs
his task, my boy. I hope, though, you won’t
start out overconfident. I’ve been here twelve years
and overconfidence at one stage or another of the
season has lost more games for us than any other
one factor. Heed the words of age and experience,
Harven, and don’t write the answer until you’ve
worked out the proposition.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not cocksure,” laughed Stuart. “I’m
confident that we can win, but I realize that we’ve
got to work every minute, and work hard. By the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
way, sir, what does amenability mean? Jack told
me that was a quality I didn’t have.”</p>

<p>“Amenability?” repeated the instructor. “It
means several things. For one, it means the quality
of being open-minded, of willingness to be governed.
We speak of a person as being amenable to reason,
which usually means that the person has taken our
advice, or, at least, listened to it.”</p>

<p>“Sounds as though he was calling me pigheaded,”
said Stuart.</p>

<p>“Hardly as bad as that,” laughed the other; “he
was probably trying to convey the idea, and convey
it as politely as possible, that you are likely to rely
too implicitly on your own judgment and are slightly
contemptuous of others’. Isn’t that more likely to
be it?”</p>

<p>“Then it means cocksure,” grunted Stuart. “I
don’t think I am. Do you, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Moffit smiled, his blue eyes twinkling. “You
and I have been pretty good friends for two years,
Harven,” he answered, “and we’ll probably remain
so as long as we don’t ask each other questions like
that.”</p>

<p>Stuart grinned. “But seriously, Mr. Moffit, am I
like he says? I don’t mean to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sure you don’t, my boy. To be frank,
there’s something in Brewton’s indictment, I fancy,
but not enough to trouble about. I’d prefer to call
it self-dependence, which, up to a point, is an admirable
attribute of youth.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s always getting off something like
that,” said Stuart. “I don’t mind him.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t. I’d just make certain that his
charge is incorrect, Harven.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Then: “Gosh, I was almost forgetting
what I came to see you about! You know Neil
Orr, Mr. Moffit. He’s eligible for a society this
year, and I’d like mightily to get him into Lyceum.
I’m pretty sure he can make Manning if he wants to,
but I’d rather have him with us, and I guess he’d
rather, too.”</p>

<p>“Orr is a splendid fellow in my judgment,”
answered Mr. Moffit, “and I’d be glad to
have him in Lyceum, but you know, Harven,
I’m only the faculty director and have no
vote.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know that, but I thought you might
speak a good word for him when the time comes.
I’m going to put him up right off.”</p>

<p>“Gladly, if my opinion is asked, but I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
promise more than that, my boy. You wouldn’t
want me to, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, of course not.” Stuart agreed, but not
very fervently. After a moment he added, “I think
some of the fellows won’t want him on account of
his being like he is, and I don’t think that’s fair.”</p>

<p>“I doubt that,” answered the instructor. “I can’t
imagine any of our fellows objecting to Orr on account
of physical—ah—disabilities, Harven. I’d
dislike to think it was so.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m wrong,” said Stuart. “Only, something
was said last spring that made me think that
way. Well, I must be off to supper. Jack is
probably as mad as a hornet by this time. Good-by,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Harven. Very glad to have seen you
again. Drop in some evening before term starts,
and bring Brewton along, won’t you?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<small>CAPTAIN AND COACH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Stuart didn’t look for Mr. Haynes that evening.
Instead, after supper in Safford’s
only restaurant, he and Jack, together with
three other early arrivals, went to the moving
picture theater, which, like the Old Elm Café, was
the sole representative of its kind in Safford.
Stuart expected to meet the coach the next morning
at breakfast, but the latter failed to show up. Pending
the opening of Memorial, meals were served to
the football players in the Lyceum House. This
was a small cottage situated across the Principal’s
Walk at the rear of Holton. In early days it had
been used as a dormitory, as had a similar structure
in the corner of the new campus. Later, the rooming
facilities had been increased by the building of
Sawyer and Byers Halls, the two cottages had been
given over to the school societies, the Lyceum and
Manning. The Lyceum House had four bedrooms
on the upper floor, and living room, dining room and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
kitchen below. This morning the dining room was
crowded when Stuart arrived. Nineteen fellows
had answered the summons to pre-season practice,
while the table seated but twelve. Fortunately, all
of them did not come at the same time. As it was,
Stuart made the fourth in the waiting line. His appearance
was the signal for loud and hearty greetings,
and there was much hand-shaking. Jack
Brewton was already there and promised Stuart his
place at table as soon as he “got outside a couple
more eggs.”</p>

<p>Most of the returning players on last year’s first
team were on hand: burly, red-haired Joe Cutts, the
center; Leo Burns, square-headed and sandy-complexioned,
as hard-fisted as he was soft-hearted,
one of the best halfbacks in recent years; “Howdy”
Tasker, big and gray-eyed and handsome, almost
certain of the fullback position; Millard Wheaton,
short but sturdy, pink-cheeked and blue-eyed, who
meant to give Stuart a hard battle for quarterback
supremacy; and others besides. Tom Muirgart,
commonly known as “Mudguard,” yielded his chair
to Stuart while Jack was still toying with his second
helping of poached eggs, and Stuart deluged his oatmeal
with milk and sprinkled it with sugar, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
pitched in. “Whitey,” general factotum of the
establishment, and as black a darkey as ever toiled in
a southern cotton field, hurried back and forth in the
seemingly hopeless endeavor to supply the wants of
the eaters. Oatmeal, bacon, eggs, stewed peaches,
toast, coffee, milk disappeared as if by magic, and
pathetic plaints filled the air constantly: “Oh,
Whitey! Got any more bacon?” “Whitey, bring
some more milk, will you?” “Coffee, Whitey; and
fill her up this time!” “Bring me two, three eggs,
Whitey; and some toast!” “A-a-ay, Whitey! I’m
starving! Get a move on, will you?”</p>

<p>At Stuart’s left a pleasant-faced, brown-eyed
youth asked: “Have you seen the coach? He was
asking for you last night.”</p>

<p>“No, what’s he like, Billy? I thought he’d be
here this morning.”</p>

<p>“Rather a nice sort. Rather smallish. Looks
keen, though.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” asked Joe Cutts from across the
board. “Mr. Haynes? Quite a peppy boy, I’ll bet!
He isn’t big, but he’s got a bad eye, son. He’ll have
us jumping for fair!”</p>

<p>“If he can make you jump he’ll be going some,”
laughed Billy Littlefield. Joe smiled tolerantly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
landed a piece of toast on Billy’s nose. Wallace
Towne, slipping into a vacated chair and absent-mindedly
annexing Howdy Tasker’s glass of milk,
joined in with:</p>

<p>“I hear there isn’t going to be any training table
this year.”</p>

<p>“Where do you get that stuff?” asked Stuart pityingly.</p>

<p>“Coach. He doesn’t believe in ’em. He told me
so yesterday. Came down on the train with him.
Says all we need is plenty of plain food and no coddling.
Told him I didn’t care how plain it was if it
was plenty.”</p>

<p>Stuart frowned. “That’s nonsense,” he declared.
“We’ve always had training tables here, and I guess
we’ll continue to.”</p>

<p>“All right. You tell ’em. Whitey, for the love
of Mike, feed me! All I’ve had’s a glass of milk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it was mine,” observed Howdy.
“Feed the brute, Whitey.”</p>

<p>“Guess the new chap’s got a lot of revolutionary
ideas,” went on Wallace. “Said a mouthful about
straight football. Hates stunt plays, I guess.
Strong on fundamentals, too. So am I. We
agreed perfectly. Made a big hit with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“You would,” said Jack scathingly. “You’d
agree with any one, you old sycophant.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Wallace untroubledly.
“An elephant’s little boy? I deny it. You’re
thinking of Joe.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen his sort before,” said Stuart. “They
start out with the idea of changing everything, but
they soon get over it.” He smiled patiently.
“That straight football guff’s mighty old stuff. It
won’t win games to-day. He’ll get over it. Got
any more eggs, Whitey?”</p>

<p>Reaching the field at half-past ten—a few minutes
beyond that time, as a matter of fact, but if the
captain can’t be late, who can?—Stuart concluded
at first glance that Mr. Haynes had again failed to
put in an appearance, and he wasn’t altogether displeased.
This new coach seemed to be acting rather
cocky, Stuart thought, and being late to practice
might tone down some of his assurance. But a
second look showed a stranger there. The fact that
he was in togs quite as disreputable as any being
worn there had disguised him. He was talking to
Miles Whittier, the assistant manager, when Stuart
made himself known. Mr. Haynes shook hands
cordially, but, Stuart thought, without as much empressement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
as the situation called for. While they
talked Stuart studied the other and was conscious of
a slight feeling of disappointment. Perhaps the
description he had heard was to blame. At all
events, the coach was much more of a “regular
fellow” than Stuart had unconsciously pictured
him. He was small, perhaps, but the fact didn’t
impress you greatly because he was remarkably well
built. He was younger than Stuart had suspected,
too; surely not more than twenty-six. He was
good looking, but the good looks were more a
matter of expression than of features, for the latter
were irregular. There was a short nose and a
rather long upper lip, a firm mouth and a square jaw,
keen dark-brown eyes and a wide forehead under
hair that appeared to have a suspicion of red in it.
He had a pleasant smile and an agreeable voice, and
yet Stuart somehow felt a trifle uncomfortable while
they conversed. Perhaps it was the penetrative
quality of the straight, unwavering regard of the
coach that was responsible.</p>

<p>For Alan Haynes was doing a little studying, too.
He wanted very much to learn what sort of a youth
this was with whom he was to work. What conclusions
he reached I do not know. He saw, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
a straight, well-made boy of a trifle more than
normal height and weight for his years, with the
good looks of regular features and perfect health.
I doubt if he read any antagonism, for I don’t think
that Stuart was conscious of any, but I think he surmised
that behind the blue-gray eyes there lay a
touch of arrogance, and perhaps the corners of the
pleasantly-smiling mouth hinted that its owner was
self-willed. Maybe because of such surmises, the
coach paid the most respectful deference to Stuart’s
words, and the latter mentally concluded that
Wallace Towne’s characterization of the new
coach had been overdrawn. Probably, he thought,
the other had talked sort of big to impress Wallace.
There was no harm in that just so long as he didn’t
try it on him!</p>

<p>“We’d better get together this evening, Harven,”
the coach was saying, “and talk things over. Suppose
I drop in at your room? I haven’t found
quarters yet, and my room at the hotel is just a
box.”</p>

<p>“Suits me, Mr. Haynes. I’m in Lacey, the
second dormitory on the Lane; Number 12; one
flight. How about eight o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Perfect. Well, shall we get them started?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>After practice the coach had company on the way
back to the village. “The Laird” was taking a
dozen or so pairs of football shoes to the repair shop.
He had them tied together by the lacings and slung
over his shoulder as the coach fell into step beside
him. His real name was Angus McCranie and he
looked as Scotch as his name sounded. It was always
somewhat of a disappointment, though, to hear
The Laird speak, for it was only in moments of excitement
that his native burr was used. He had
been trainer at Manning for nearly a dozen years
and had become as much a part of the institution as
Manning Hall or Old Jarratt, the Greek and Latin
professor, or even Doctor Gurley himself. He was
short and leanly muscular, with grizzled hair and
pale blue eyes that shone startlingly bright from under
thick tufts of brows and from a seamed face
that, summer or winter, was always the color of a
well-worn saddle. In age, The Laird was, by his
own confession, “upwards of thirty.” The register
in the little town of his birth would have proved him
well over forty. But age was of small importance
in his case. He was still as spry, to all appearances,
as he had been a dozen years since; and another
score of years would make little difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“And what did you think of the lads, sir?” asked
The Laird, as they took the turn of High Street
near Manning Society House.</p>

<p>“Excellent,” answered the coach promptly and
emphatically. “A fine looking lot, I call them.
What is your opinion of this year’s material, Mr.
McCranie?”</p>

<p>The Laird produced a briar pipe and began to
fill it. “About average, sir. Mr. Haynes, the more
I see of the lads, sir, the more settled I become as to
one conviction, which is that you can’t ever tell
what’s in a pudding till you open the bag.”</p>

<p>“Meaning,” responded the other, “that good-looking
bodies don’t always land first over the hurdles.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, sir. I’ve seen fine, upstanding lads
licked by runts in my time, and I’ve seen promising
teams just fairly fall to pieces during a season.
Man, it’s not the shape of a lad’s body, or the muscles
that play under his skin that counts. It’s
what’s on the inside. It’s the spirit of him!”</p>

<p>“True,” assented Mr. Haynes.</p>

<p>“And that’s why, sir, when they say to me ‘What
do you think of the team this year,’ or the squad,
maybe, I tell them the same thing. ‘Wait till they’ve
got their first black eye,’ I say, ‘and then ask me!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Haynes nodded gravely. “That’s what
brings out the spirit,” he replied. He paused midway
of the bridge and looked down into the slowly
moving stream. “Any fish in this river?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Laird leaned an elbow on the railing, blew a
cloud of smoke into the sunlight and shook his
head sadly. “There used to be, sir. I’ve caught
ten-inch trout further up. But three years ago they
built a mill at the falls and now you’ll get nothing
saving a shiner or two. It’s a shame, it is so!”</p>

<p>“Too bad! Ten inches, eh? That’s nice fishing.
Flies or worms, Mr. McCranie?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you the truth, sir,” chuckled the
trainer. “I’m as prideful an angler as any, Mr.
Haynes, but as the Good Book says, pride goeth before
the Falls. ’Twas worms I used.”</p>

<p>Further on Mr. Haynes said: “Captain Harven is
rather a brilliant player, I understand, Mr. McCranie.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, sir. ’Twas he won the Pearsall
game last fall. A very clever lad, Mr. Haynes.
One of the finest quarters we’ve ever had here.
And a grand runner. ’Twas his getting away for
nearly sixty yards that brought us the victory.
After that he could have been president if the lads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
could have made him such. They did the best they
might, and, in spite of his being only a third-class
boy this year, elected him captain.”</p>

<p>“A steady player?” inquired the coach casually.</p>

<p>The Laird shot a quick, keen glance at him.
“You’re fair observing, sir. I’ll not say the lad’s a
steady player, for he’s not, but you’ll be forgiving
him that for the way he plays when he’s at his best.
He’s high-strung like, with a wee bit of temper, but
a fine lad for all, sir. There’s two kinds. There’s
them that’s always reliable. You know beforehand
what they’ll time at every lap. They’re grand,
but there’s never a surprise in them, sir. Their time
to-day is their time to-morrow, barring an accident.
Then there’s the other sort. To-day you’ll click
them one time, to-morrow another. You never
know for certain what they’ll do. But when the
time comes they’re like thoroughbred horses, Mr.
Haynes. A touch of the spur and they tear loose,
sir, and naught can head them. Maybe they’ll drop,
past the line, but they’ll win!”</p>

<p>“That sort requires careful handling,” mused the
coach.</p>

<p>“Man, you speak true! Haven’t I learned it?
But they’re worth the trouble, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll stop here,” said Mr. Haynes as they
reached the hotel. “I hope you and I will get along
splendidly, Mr. McCranie. I shall look to you for
a lot of advice, for I’m pretty much of a stranger
yet.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get along grand, sir,” replied the trainer
heartily, “and I’m not denying there’s things I can
tell you, for I’m an old dog here. But I’ll be asking
you drop the ‘Mister,’ sir. McCranie’s my name, or
Angus if you like it better. The lads call me The
Laird, and that’s a name I’m fair proud of, Mr.
Haynes, for they’d never have given it me if I’d not
come by it rightly.”</p>

<p>“Very well, McCranie. And my name is Haynes,
also without the ‘Mister.’”</p>

<p>“It is now,” replied the trainer, with a chuckle,
“but I’m thinking that when we’re better acquainted
’twill be just ‘Coach’!”</p>

<small>A BOY ON CRUTCHES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two workouts that day, although each was
brief, left Stuart’s body rather lame, for,
while he had led a mildly strenuous life in
camp and at sea during the last three months, some
of the muscles brought into play in football practice
were decidedly flabby. At supper that first evening,
although he hid his twinges, the fact that he appeared
to be the only one of the squad inconvenienced
by the day’s activities caused him to acknowledge
to himself that there might be something in
summer training after all!</p>

<p>He prepared for the conference with Coach
Haynes by determining to be rather on his dignity,
telling himself that, in the interest of future harmony,
it would be well to deal with the other with a
firm hand, to let him understand right at the start
that revolutionary changes in the conduct of the
team or the campaign would not be welcomed.
There was, for instance, the coach’s plan of doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
away with the training table, as silly an idea as Stuart
had ever heard of! Stern measures now might
prevent later trouble, the captain reflected.</p>

<p>The coach, however, appeared in a most conciliatory
mood, paid respectful attention to Stuart’s ideas
and failed to show the cloven hoof at all. On
several occasions Stuart forgot his dignity and, to
his later annoyance, found himself laughing heartily.
They made excellent progress. Some of the coach’s
notions didn’t coincide with Stuart’s, but he was so
far from insistent, so evidently open to conviction,
that for the most part the captain let them pass unchallenged.
After all, Mr. Haynes had no more to
say in favor of a thorough grounding of the team in
the fundamentals than Stuart knew to be tenable.
Nor, though he certainly showed a leaning toward
the old-style football, did he asperse the newer and
trickier plays. He found some fault with the
schedule, but there Stuart was at one with him, for
undoubtedly the playing of Walsenburg as early as
the middle of October was a mistake. Stuart explained
that Walsenburg had refused a later date and
that, rather than lose the benefit to be had from a
game with an opponent of Walsenburg’s mettle, it
had been decided to take her on in early season, slipping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Williston down the schedule to the Saturday
before Pearsall.</p>

<p>“We must just make up our minds to a defeat on
October 16, then,” replied the coach smilingly.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure, sir,” said Stuart. “We’ve got
quite a bunch of veterans this year and I guess we’ll
be able to squeeze through with no worse than a tie.
Walsenburg won’t be running very strong herself at
that time.”</p>

<p>“Those big schools start out stronger than we do,”
said the coach. “We won’t trouble about it, though.
Sometimes, I think, a trimming isn’t bad medicine
for a team along in the early season. It’s likely to
cure overconfidence.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we rather hate to get licked here at
Manning,” demurred Stuart, frowning. “And
Walsenburg hasn’t beaten us but once in four years.
I—I don’t think the fellows would take very kindly
to it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hatred of defeat is a credited aversion, Harven,
but it isn’t always wise to win. Sometimes the
cost is too great. I never like to bring a team
along too fast in October. Usually you pay for it
later. Well, we can deal with the Walsenburg game
when it comes. Tell me about Lansing High<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
School. That comes first, doesn’t it? Yes, well,
what do they usually do?”</p>

<p>Afterwards they discussed the players. Mr.
Haynes seemed particularly anxious to learn about
the linemen. “We’re strong at the center, you
say?” he asked. “‘Got veterans there,’ have we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and corkers! Cutts, the big red-haired
fellow, you know; and Beeman and Towne for
guards. And we’re fixed for tackles, too, Mr.
Haynes. Jack Brewton’s one of the best in the
business, and Ned Thurston’s nearly as good.
‘Thirsty’s’ been playing tackle two years already.
Jack was in every game but one last season and he’s a
whale.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good. I liked the looks of Brewton immensely.
He’s the ideal build for tackle. Cutts
seemed a trifle heavy for a center, though. But
perhaps he’s a bit overweight. I have a weakness
for fast men in the center, Harven.”</p>

<p>“Well, Joe isn’t so slow, and I guess he’s due to
drop eight or ten pounds in the next week. You’ll
like him when you see him work, sir.”</p>

<p>The subject of the abolishment of the training
table was not introduced by the coach and so it didn’t
come up for discussion. After the other had taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
his departure, Stuart rehearsed the evening and uneasily
came to the conclusion that so far as firmness
was concerned he had not been an overwhelming success.
Still, there hadn’t been much chance for firmness.
He consoled himself with the promise to
maintain a watchful eye on the coach and be on
guard against that gentleman’s smooth diplomacy.</p>

<p>Practice went very well. Other candidates
showed up day by day, and on Sunday, Fred Locker,
the manager, returned. Stuart was glad to see him,
for Fred was a hard-working, invaluable chap and,
moreover, a firm adherent of Stuart’s; and now and
then the latter felt dimly that, should it ever come to
a show-down between him and the new coach, he
would need all the backing he could get. There
was no doubt that Mr. Haynes had found much
favor with the football squad. There was constant
proof of it. They had already conferred a nickname
on him and, save to his face, he was called
“Hop,” that being a favorite ejaculation of his used
on all sorts of occasions. He didn’t join the players
at meals in Lyceum House, but none seemed to
feel himself affronted, although Mr. Craig, the former
coach, had always presided at the head of the
table. Mr. Haynes had found quarters just across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the river, convenient to the school, and on Sunday
evening Stuart and Fred Locker and The Laird met
there and went very thoroughly into many questions.</p>

<p>The fall term began Tuesday, and on Monday the
influx of returning students began. Rumor had it
that the school was to be filled this year, which meant
an enrollment of three hundred and fifty. Not
since the opening of Byers, the latest of the new
dormitories, had the school held a full quota, and the
report was pleasing to Stuart, among others, since,
theoretically at least, the more students there were
the more football players there would be. He
hoped that among the new fellows entering the
senior or upper middle classes there would be a
few experienced ones, perhaps even a star or two.
To anticipate a trifle, however, Stuart’s hope proved
vain, for among the newcomers there was but one
fellow of first team caliber. Haley Leonard, entering
the upper middle class, had weight and a year’s
experience behind him and, after being miscast for
part of the season in a rushline position, was relegated
to the backfield and made good as fullback.</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, one of the numerous carriages
that rattled to and fro between the station
and the school that day, stopped in front of Lacey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Hall and three boys emerged. Two of them hustled
forth, paid the driver and were quickly swallowed up
in the entrance to the dormitory. But the third
member of the trio alighted more slowly, and it is
with this third youth that we have to do. First the
end of a pair of crutches came into sight. Then, the
rubbered tips secure on the pavement, a boy of sixteen
swung himself nimbly out. Seen without his
crutches, there was nothing in his appearance to suggest
physical disability. He looked to be normally
strong and healthy, with the usual number of arms
and legs, a well-developed torso, and a good-looking,
clean-cut countenance wherein a pair of very deep
blue eyes constituted the most attractive feature.
Settling with the driver, he accepted the bag which
the latter handed to him and, with surprising dexterity,
took himself and bag across the walk and up
the steps. Once inside, however, his progress became
slower, for the steep stone stairway presented
difficulties when a suitcase hung against the right-hand
crutch. Had any one appeared he would have
given over his burden, but as it was he made the
ascent alone, and, at last gaining the second floor,
swung himself along more quickly than another
would have walked to the portal of Number 12. Inside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the room the expression of pleasure faded from
his face, for there was no one there to greet him.
Setting down his bag, he looked at his watch and understood.</p>

<p>“Practice,” he muttered. “I might have remembered.”
The qualm of disappointment vanished
and, abandoning one of his crutches, he set
about the unpacking of his suit case. From bag to
chiffonier, closet and table he went quickly and efficiently,
sometimes throwing his full weight on the
remaining crutch, sometimes placing an aiding hand
on table or chair back or bedstead. Presently, since
his trunk was still to arrive, his task was completed
and he seated himself in a chair that faced the south
window, laying the crutch beside him. It would
have taken keen observation then to have suspected
anything wrong with the apparently sound limbs
stretched before him, yet the truth is that never in all
his life had they once sustained his full weight.
Place Neil Orr in the water and he could swim like a
fish, but ashore and minus his crutches he was as
helpless as a crawling baby. Perhaps had he once
had the full use of his legs he would have minded the
lack of it a great deal, but as it was, while he often
envied others their ability to walk and run and take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
part in athletics, he was quite contented with his lot.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Lord had been fully as kind to Neil
as to seemingly more fortunate youths, for while
Neil had been denied the usual means of locomotion
he had been blessed with a happy disposition; and
were I forced to make choice of the two gifts I’d
never hesitate in choosing the happy disposition.
You are not to suppose that Neil was one of those
objectionably cheerful idiots who, when you pound
your thumb with a hammer under the mistaken
idea that you’re hitting a nailhead, smilingly reminds
you, while you dance around with your thumb in
your mouth, that it would have been much worse had
you been using an ax, and that “it will be all the same
ten years from now.” A sense of proportion must
accompany a happy disposition if the latter is to be
of use, and in Neil’s case it did. He also had a nice
sense of humor and a kindliness of heart that won
him friends everywhere. Among those who knew
Neil only by sight there were probably some who
wondered that Stuart Harven should forgo the
privilege of spending his upper middle year in the
greater comfort of Meigs Hall in order to remain
with the younger boy, but those who were acquainted
with the latter didn’t wonder at all. Jack Brewton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
close friend of both, smiled to himself when Stuart
explained that he had decided to stay on in Lacey
because it didn’t seem fair to Neil not to. Stuart
honestly thought that he was conferring a benefit,
but Jack knew that he was receiving it!</p>

<p>Stuart and Neil had been friendly acquaintances
before coming to Manning. Back home, in Springfield,
they had gone to school together, been of the
same “crowd” and done the same things. Although
they were nearly of an age, Stuart was the senior by
four months—Neil had always been one year behind
the other in school, owing to the fact that Stuart
possessed a faculty for, as he phrased it, “hitting the
high places” in his studies. Teachers shook their
heads over that faculty. They knew perfectly well
that Stuart was, to make use of another convenient
phrase, “beating the game,” but there was nothing
they could do about it. He got high marks, even
though his instructors were convinced that he knew
far less of the subjects than did many boys who were
marked much lower, and there was nothing for it but
to pass him. Some did it sadly, with earnest exhortations
to more serious and thorough work,
others did it quite as grudgingly but with a secret
envy for a quality not possessed by their plodding,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
slow-going minds. Once interested in a course,
Stuart could fairly “eat it up,” but the trouble was
that few courses interested him, and even during his
two years at Manning—he had entered the lower
middle class—he had continued to rely on his uncanny
ability to learn just enough and no more than
was necessary to keep him in good standing. Since
the classes were larger here, he managed to fool
many of the instructors and even gain a reputation
for brilliancy, which reputation helped him to go on
fooling them. Among the few who were not deceived
was the English instructor, Mr. Moffit. Mr.
Moffit—Miss Muffit the boys called him—said one
day, half in fun, half in earnest: “Harven, you’re a
smart chap, but your smartness is the Devil’s kind,
and some day you may regret it. A juggler may
toss up a glass bowl and a silk hat and a billiard cue
ninety-nine times and catch the hat on his head, the
cue on his chin and the bowl on the cue. But the
hundredth time something goes wrong and there’s an
awful smash. Better watch out for the hundredth
time, my boy!” To which Stuart had replied
apologetically: “Maybe I don’t go into things as
hard as I should, sir, but there’s lots of time yet.
You wait till I get to college!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Neil didn’t have Stuart’s gift, fortunately or unfortunately,
as you choose to view it, and he worked
much harder for no better surface results. He regarded
his friend’s method with secret doubt but
never criticized it. When he reached Manning, a
year after Stuart, it seemed quite natural that they
should take a room together. Neil admired and
liked Stuart for the qualities that attracted other
fellows, and, besides, for his athleticism. Even in
the early school days Stuart had been a leader in
games of all sorts. Stuart was as willing as Neil to
join forces. He liked the other boy immensely, and
was sorry for him, although there was something in
Neil’s attitude that prohibited pity, and felt that it
would be a friendly act to look after him and see
that his physical disability didn’t act as a handicap.
They had spent a year together in the corner room in
Lacey and everything had gone wonderfully. You
couldn’t quarrel with Neil if you wanted to because
he simply wouldn’t have it. If you got nasty Neil
merely retired within his undisturbed self and waited
for you to get over your mood. Then he went on
again as if nothing had happened. There might
have been rows aplenty had Neil desired them, for,
while Stuart wasn’t quarrelsome, he was fond of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
his own opinions and impatient of others’. But
Neil didn’t consider his views or any one else’s views
of much importance, certainly not important enough
to become ruffled over! What had begun as mutual
respect and liking had grown within one school year
to something much deeper and stronger, though,
boylike, neither would have cared to give a name to
it.</p>

<p>The shadows were growing long on the campus
when Stuart returned to No. 12. The greetings
exchanged were almost casual, but the handclasp was
hard and the faces of both boys showed their
pleasure.</p>

<p>“I’m beastly sorry I couldn’t meet you, Neil,”
said Stuart, “but I couldn’t cut practice to-day.
How long have you been here?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps an hour. I unpacked my bag and have
been waiting for my trunk. There’s some of your
laundry in it, by the way. Your mother sent it over
yesterday and asked me to bring it along.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Well, how are you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” smiled Neil. “Don’t I look fairly
healthy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say you do. And you’ve got a corking tan.
Where’d you get it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“I was on the river a good deal. You aren’t exactly
pallid yourself, you know.”</p>

<p>“I know. Hot, isn’t it? Haynes gave us nearly
two hours to-day, drat him!”</p>

<p>“Tell me about him, Stuart. What’s he like?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess. Rather nice-looking chap.
Pleasant and all that.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said Neil. “I hope you’re going to
get on together all right.”</p>

<p>Stuart frowned slightly. “Why shouldn’t we?
Gee, you talk as if I didn’t usually get on with
folks!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” replied the other. “What’s
the news? Who’s back? How’s Jack?”</p>

<p>“Jack’s all right. Most of the fellows we know
are here, I guess. There isn’t much news though.
We’ve put in four days of hard practice, two sessions
daily, and things look pretty good. We’ve
got a corking lot of fellows to start with. If
Haynes doesn’t develop too many fool notions I
guess we’ll have a record season.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I’d hate horribly to have Pearsall
beat us this year, when you’re captain. What do
you mean by fool notions, Stuart? Is the new
coach notional?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Sort of.” Stuart frowned again. “Most of it’s
just talk, though, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Do the fellows like him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They won’t, though, if he keeps on working
them as hard as he did Saturday and to-day.
By the way, I’m putting you up for Lyceum to-morrow,
Neil, so you’d better get ready to ride the goat.”</p>

<p>Neil smiled. “Thanks. I’ll practice on the footboard
of the bed.”</p>

<p>“I told you so you could turn down Manning if
they got after you.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like being beforehand,” replied
Neil demurely.</p>

<p>“Well, they’d get you if they could, I guess.
What are you looking so foxy about? Have they
been after you already?”</p>

<p>Neil laughed and nodded. “More than a month
ago. Greg Trenholme wrote me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! What did you tell him?”</p>

<p>“Declined, with proper expression of polite regret.
I dare say I’d feel rather the fool if I failed
at Lyceum. Still——”</p>

<p>“Fail? Why should you? Don’t be an ass!
You’ll go through flying. Well, let’s get washed up.
I’m as hungry as a bear!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>“ONLY THE CAPTAIN!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The football training table was customarily
formed about four days after the beginning
of the term. It was in reality two
tables, at which were gathered some twenty-two of
the foremost candidates. Precedent had established
a hard-and-fast dietary, of which such articles as
underdone steaks and chops and roasts of beef
formed the fixed basis. Fresh bread was taboo, as
was pastry and most other forms of dessert. Eggs,
certain cereals, milk and fresh vegetables and fruit
formed the balance of the menu. A patented preparation
of grain took the place of coffee. Usually
by the time the season drew to an end you got so you
could drink the substitute without making a face.
But before that time you had become heartily sick
of the monotony of the food and sighed deeply for
such health-destroying viands as baked macaroni,
apple pie, broiled ham, suet puddings and coffee—especially
and constantly coffee! Even the twice-a-week<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
ice cream, observed enviously by the neighboring
tables, didn’t make up for the breaded veal cutlets
or hot rolls that passed with teasing fragrance
but never stopped. The training table necessitated
what practically amounted to the preparation of two
meals in the school kitchen, a fact that doubtless led
the faculty to listen sympathetically to the suggestion
of Mr. Haynes. This suggestion reached the
faculty by way of the Committee on Athletics,
popularly called the “Athletic Faculty,” and was submitted
with the committee’s entire approval. The
suggestion was no less than the abolishment of the
training table. The first regular faculty conference
was held Thursday evening. Mr. Pierson, assistant
instructor in English and chairman of the Athletic
Faculty, laid the matter before the meeting and read
the written argument by the new coach. Subject, he
stated, to the approval of the school faculty, the
Committee on Athletics proposed to give the plan a
trial. After a discussion which, considering the
revolutionary character of the proposal, was extremely
brief, the faculty set the seal of its approval;
without, you will observe, consulting Captain Stuart
Harven in the least.</p>

<p>In fact Stuart knew nothing of it until Friday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
forenoon, and then learned of it in the most haphazard
fashion. Wallace Towne, waiting for H
Room to empty so that he might attend a Latin class
before he had quite forgotten all he had learned
overnight, caught Stuart in the corridor of Manning.
“See I was in the know about training table, Cap,”
he said. “I’m always there with the inside info.
What do you think of it? No more raw meat to
make us savage. No more parched corn playing
coffee. Real food. Great, I say!”</p>

<p>“What are you jabbering about, Wally?” asked
Stuart.</p>

<p>“Mean you don’t know?” Wallace looked incredulous.
“Why, dearie, faculty’s abolished the
dear old training table! Give you my word! It’s
a thing of the past. Just like the dodo bird and the
tandem play and— All right, ask Jud McColl if
you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy,” declared Stuart. But his words
lacked conviction. “You can’t build up a football
team without a training table!”</p>

<p>“I can’t, no, but Hop Haynes can. Hop’s the
Moses that’s going to lead us through the Red Sea
of dish gravy into the Pruneless Land. Say, that’s
good, what? Have to send that to the ‘Bull’!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>(He did, and <cite>The Bulletin</cite> printed it, slightly
elaborated, in the Caught on the Campus column.)</p>

<p>Stuart reiterated his doubt of Wallace’s sanity and
took himself into Latin class, Wallace, still chuckling
over his <i lang="fr">bon mot</i>, following. Stuart wasn’t
easy in his mind, though, in spite of his expressed
contempt for Wallace’s information, and added
nothing to his laurels as a Latin scholar that morning.
Oddly enough, Judson McColl was the first
fellow Stuart’s eyes fell on when the class was over.
McColl was Prominence personified. He was President
of the recently formed Student Council, President
of Manning Society, Captain of the Hockey
Team and, with Stearns Wilson, represented the
student body on the Athletic Faculty. In spite of all
these honors, however, McColl was simple, likable
and approachable. He expressed regretful surprise
that Stuart had been unaware of the proposed abolition
of the training table.</p>

<p>“I supposed of course you knew, Stuart,” he said.
“Mr. Haynes introduced the proposal several days
ago.”</p>

<p>McColl looked so puzzled that Stuart fancied his
dignity in danger. “Of course I heard something
about it,” he replied defensively, “but I didn’t know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
it had been brought up. Personally, I think it’s a
crazy scheme, Jud.”</p>

<p>“We-ell, I don’t know.” McColl pursed his lips.
“Haynes made out a strong case, Stuart. Of
course, if it doesn’t work we’ll go back to the old
way. We thought there’d be no harm in giving it
a trial, eh?”</p>

<p>Stuart shrugged. “Seems to me it would have
been fairer to give the players a voice in the matter,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Don’t agree with you there,” replied McColl.
“Things like that are up to the Committee. Anyway,
about all the football fellows I’ve talked with
are in favor of it.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked incredulous, but, having no data to
base a contrary assertion on, he let the statement
pass unchallenged. Parting from McColl, he went
over to Meigs to unburden his mind to Jack. Jack,
of course would share his indignation. But neither
Jack nor Stearns Wilson, his roommate, was in, and
Stuart went across to Lacey and spent the period before
dinner nursing his sense of injury. Neil had a
class and didn’t show up before the midday meal,
and Stuart had sufficient time and solitude to work
up a very fair case against Coach Haynes and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Athletic Faculty. Thinking things over, it struck
him as peculiar, if not suspicious, that Jack, who,
since he roomed with Stearns Wilson, must have
known about the training table matter, hadn’t spoken
of it to him. Stuart uneasily wondered if Jack
favored the absurd change. McColl had said that
many of the players did. Perhaps Jack was one of
them and, knowing Stuart’s position in the matter,
had purposely avoided the subject. Jack became
grouped in Stuart’s mind with those others who had
conspired to bring about an iniquitous change by underhand
methods. He decided to see Coach Haynes
immediately after dinner and speak his mind.
After all, Haynes was the chief culprit.</p>

<p>At dinner Stuart broached the matter to Leo
Burns and Harry Beeman, the only members of the
squad at his table, and was pained, even disgusted,
to discover that they were heartily in favor of the
change. Beeman, who, as a first-string man and a
veteran, should have had more sense, was eloquent
on the merits of the new plan, and Stuart retired disgruntledly
from the subject. The left guard made
himself more obnoxious by taking it for granted
that his views were the captain’s.</p>

<p>Stuart’s hike to Coach Haynes’ quarters in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
village after dinner produced no satisfaction, for the
coach wasn’t there. He waited awhile, but Mr.
Haynes didn’t come. Having to hurry back to
school under an ardent September sun so as not to
be late for a half-past-one recitation didn’t improve
Stuart’s temper any. It was in the gymnasium at
three-thirty that he finally unburdened his mind.
His arraignment wasn’t nearly so harsh as he had intended
it should be, for Mr. Haynes was so palpably
sincere in his regrets that Stuart had to pull in his
horns at the very beginning.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have had it happen for anything,” declared
the coach earnestly. “I was certain that I had
spoken of the matter to you, Captain Harven. I
surely intended to. I went into it with quite a
number of the fellows, I know. So many things
have come up the past week, though, I’ve been so
rushed and confused, that probably I failed to consult
you.”</p>

<p>“You certainly did,” replied Stuart stiffly. “And,
naturally, I was rather surprised this morning to
learn that the matter had come up and been decided.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” Mr. Haynes was evidently
grieved. “Of course you should have been consulted,
and I can’t see how I failed to bring it up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
you. You’re quite sure it wasn’t mentioned?
There was that long talk we had in your room one
night——”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t mentioned then, sir, nor at any other
time. Perhaps I wouldn’t mind so much if—if I
approved, but I don’t, Mr. Haynes.”</p>

<p>“Really? By jove, I’m sorry to hear that! So
many of the fellows favored it, you see, Harven.
No one I spoke to was against giving the plan a
trial. It isn’t an experiment, Harven, although it
is new here. We tried it out my last two years at
Fisherville and it worked splendidly. You couldn’t
get one person there to-day to speak in favor of the
training table. We got far better results without it.
We didn’t lose a single game last year, and only one
the year before. Three years ago we lost four out
of eight. That tells the story, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Stuart frowned, unconvinced. “How can you
tell it was that, Mr. Haynes? You might have done
just the same with a training table, I’d say.”</p>

<p>“The condition of the fellows was better, Harven;
thirty per cent better at least. It isn’t rare beefsteak
and thick cream and the rest of the stereotyped
training table diet that produces the best results.
I’ve seen teams spoiled by overeating time and again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Loading your stomach with rich, heavy food is
simply folly. It doesn’t make for strength and
energy, Harven. Plain food, plenty of it, but never
too much, is my belief.”</p>

<p>“If the fellows eat around at different tables, how
are you going to see that they eat what they should?”</p>

<p>“You don’t.” Mr. Haynes smiled. “They see to
that themselves. It doesn’t take them long to learn
the lesson. Those who prefer to eat what isn’t good
for them to playing football are no loss to us. But
you’ll find there aren’t many such: perhaps one or
two in a squad of forty. It isn’t just a case of being
put on honor, Harven; it’s a case of using your common
sense. If you don’t eat wisely you don’t keep
in condition, and if you aren’t in condition you don’t
play on the team. Just as soon as the fellows get
that into their heads there’s no trouble. The fare
here is good enough and sufficient enough and varied
enough for any fellow to train on, Harven, and I’ll
guarantee to show you a better-conditioned squad by
the first of November than Manning ever saw here
when training tables were used.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t spoil the crowd we’ve got here this
year no matter what you fed them!” replied Stuart
stubbornly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you could! You’d only have to feed
them on underdone beef twice a day, and fill them
with rich cream, and encourage them to eat all they’d
hold. I’ve seen it tried pretty often. I went
through it myself, too. I’ve been so logy after a
dinner of that sort that it was an effort to stretch my
arms! Look here, Captain Harven, keep an open
mind on this question, won’t you? Just sit back and
see how it turns out. We both want to secure the
best possible results this year, and I think this is one
way to do it. Don’t think that I’m simply experimenting
with the team, for I’m not. I’m convinced
that this way is the best. If I weren’t I wouldn’t
consider it for a moment. I’m mighty sorry that
the thing went through without your cognizance, and
I certainly apologize for my share of the blame.
But it has gone through, and so, even if you don’t
feel like giving it your full approval yet, you’ll help
me to make it go, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Stuart shrugged. “I don’t see how I could do
anything else,” he answered. “Only—well, I’ll wait
and see. I’ve got to be shown, sir.”</p>

<p>“Quite right! We’ll leave it so. Now we’d
better get out, eh?”</p>

<p>All during practice the conviction persisted in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Stuart’s mind that, in spite of Mr. Haynes’ smooth
words something, as he phrased it to himself, had
been put over on him. He felt aggrieved, even
humiliated, and regretted that he hadn’t talked up to
the coach harder than he had. The trouble was, he
reflected, that Mr. Haynes was so blamed polite and
plausible that you couldn’t talk the way you wanted
to! Instead of interfering with his work, however,
Stuart’s grievance that afternoon induced redoubled
exertion, and he drove A squad so hard and put so
much vim and snap into his work that, in the twenty
minutes of scrimmaging, the veterans twice carried
the ball nearly the length of the field for a score.
The Laird, hovering up and down the side line,
frowned dubiously. Such speed had no place on
a gridiron where a thermometer, had there been
such a thing, would have registered around
seventy!</p>

<p>Going back to the gymnasium afterward, Stuart
charged Jack with black treachery. “You knew
what was going on, didn’t you?” he demanded.
“Stearns must have talked about it. Why didn’t
you say something to me?”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you knew!” expostulated Jack.
“Of course Stearns mentioned it, but there wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
much talk. I knew you didn’t like the scheme and I
supposed you were putting up a fight.”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty funny,” growled the other. “Every
fellow in school seems to have known all about it except
me! It’s the silliest stunt I ever heard of!
First thing we know Haynes’ll be springing a scheme
to cut out practice!”</p>

<p>“Well, he hasn’t shown any sign of it yet,” replied
Jack dryly. “Looks to me like he was a
plaguey sight more likely to overwork us than underwork
us! We’ve had more hard practice in a week
than we had last fall in two weeks! And you’re as
bad as he is. Looked like you were trying to play us
off our feet to-day!”</p>

<p>“Do you good,” muttered Stuart. “Are you in
favor of no training table, too?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Jack cautiously. “I
do think that we sometimes ate too much last year.
I’ve seen Joe Cutts get away with two steaks and
three baked potatoes, besides all the trimmings, at
one meal. And you’ll remember that half of us
were no good at all for a whole week in October last
season. The Laird said we’d been eating too many
eggs and too much milk.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won, didn’t we? A touch of biliousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
is nothing. You can’t keep thirty-odd fellows
in perfect trim every day for two months. That
stands to reason. Eating too much doesn’t help, of
course, but eating the wrong sort of stuff is worse.
And that’s what a lot of chaps will do when there’s
no one to look after them. Haynes says it worked
fine at Fisherville, but Fisherville isn’t Manning.
Besides, they always take mighty good pains at
Fisherville to take on only teams they know they
can lick!”</p>

<p>“I guess it isn’t that bad,” laughed Jack. “You
don’t like Fisherville; that’s your trouble. The
truth is, though, that Fisherville turned out just
about the best and smoothest team in this part of the
country last fall, and you can’t get around that, old
chap.”</p>

<p>“We’d have beaten her if she’d given us a chance,”
growled Stuart. “They’re mighty careful not to
give us a game.”</p>

<p>“Haynes said the other day he would arrange a
game next season.”</p>

<p>“He may think so,” answered Stuart pessimistically,
“but Fisherville will find an excuse. You
wait and see.”</p>

<p>Later, Stuart sought sympathy from Neil and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
after a fashion, got it. Neil agreed that Stuart
should have been consulted in the matter; agreed,
too, that doing away with the training table was
most unfortunate if Stuart’s forebodings should
prove justified. “Maybe, though, Mr. Haynes
meant to consult you, as he says he did,” continued
Neil. “I guess he has had a good deal to think
about since he took hold, eh? It’s all pretty new to
him, Stuart. It was decent of him to apologize.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of his apology?” demanded the
other impatiently. “Whether he meant to consult
me or not, he didn’t, and it makes me feel rather
small, naturally. I’m captain of the team, and I
ought to have a little say in its affairs. It doesn’t
look as if I were going to, though! Haynes has the
Athletic Faculty with him, and can do as he likes, I
guess. I should think either Jud or Stearns might
have asked my opinion before buckling under to
him. They’re supposed to look after the interests
of the fellows, but all they think about is pleasing
Haynes.”</p>

<p>Neil let that pass without comment. After a
moment he asked: “Do you really think it will
work badly, Stuart, this new plan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. But what’s the good of it?
We got along all right before, didn’t we? Why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
does he have to come and upset things? Faculty’s
crazy to give in to him this way, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s wait and see how it turns out,” advised
Neil. “Mr. Haynes must think he’s right, or
he wouldn’t advocate it. If he’s wrong, of course
they’ll go back to the training table again. Just
don’t let it upset you, Stuart. That’s the main
thing. Steady on, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter about me,” muttered Stuart
ironically. “I’m only the captain!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<small>A CLASH OF AUTHORITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Manning disposed of Lansing High
School the next day without difficulty.
The score, 20 to 0, did not, in fact, represent
the true strength of the home team, for in the
last half Coach Haynes ran in a bewildering number
of substitutes who, while they held the opponent
from scoring, were not able to add to the twenty
points already won. The Cherry-and-Gray showed
excellent form, rather better than was customary in
a first contest, and Manning strolled away from the
field comfortably certain that this year’s “Cherries”
were going to prove themselves one of the Big
Teams in the school’s history. Indeed, with
practically six seasoned veterans to build around,
there was no apparent reason why the team shouldn’t
turn out to be as good as any in recent years.
Stuart was in gay spirits that evening, and only the
fact that his proposal of Neil to membership in
Lyceum was to be acted on kept him from joining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Jack and “Howdy” Tasker and Fred Locker and
several more of the football crowd in a visit to Safford’s
one movie house. Jack, bursting hilariously
into Number 12 after supper with an announcement
of the party, had to be satisfied with Neil’s acceptance.
Stuart watched them join the others at the
gate and go off along School Lane, and felt rather
virtuous and heroic.</p>

<p>When he reached Lyceum House he found that
various Saturday night diversions had reduced the
attendance at the first regular meeting to less than a
score of fellows. Stearns Wilson was there of
course, for he was President, and so, in his rôle of
faculty director, was Mr. Moffit. Thurston,
Whaley, Tom Muirgart and Steve Le Gette represented
the football element. Stuart wasn’t
especially pleased to see Le Gette, who was a big,
dark-complexioned, curly-haired fellow of eighteen,
a senior and candidate for a tackle position. Stuart
had nothing especial against the other. He doubted
if they had spoken a hundred words to each other
since they had been in school. But he didn’t like
Le Gette’s sardonic smile, which always made him
feel that the big black-haired fellow was secretly
laughing at him, and he was pretty certain that Le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Gette liked him no better. But his annoyance at
sight of the other—if it deserved the name—was
slight and passing.</p>

<p>The secretary was painfully long-winded with his
report, but he finished it at last and at least six members
relievedly moved its adoption. Balloting on the
names of five candidates for election started then.
Neil’s name came last, and Stuart made his little
speech—and did it very well since he had the knack
of talking well to an audience—and Stearns Wilson
seconded the proposal very nicely, saying much more
than Stuart had dared hope he would when he had
enlisted his aid. As no one asked Mr. Moffit’s
opinion, the director could not enter the lists on behalf
of the candidate. But after all, Stuart reflected,
it was of no consequence, for among the
small number present there was surely no one to
vote against a fellow as well liked as Neil. Even as
he made this reflection, though, his gaze fell on
Steve Le Gette and an instant’s doubt assailed him.
But it passed quickly. Blackballing a candidate for
election to Lyceum was something that wasn’t done
without good cause, without strong conviction of
the candidate’s undesirability, and Le Gette scarcely
knew Neil and certainly could have nothing against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
him. George Whaley briefly added his second and
voting began. Each member walked to the table,
picked a ball from the outer compartment of the box
and dropped it into the inner. Conversation, interrupted
by the speeches, began again. Stuart, talking
to Mr. Moffit, faltered as he watched Le Gette
stride to the box and cast his vote, and then secretly
laughed at himself for his doubt.</p>

<p>Will Severence, the secretary, drew aside the cover
as casually as he had on four previous occasions.
Then, however, his manner altered abruptly and he
glanced swiftly, questioningly about the room.
After a moment’s hesitation he announced: “One
contrary vote, fellows,” and held up a little black
ball. A second of silence followed. Then several
spoke at once, but it was Muirgart’s voice that was
loudest.</p>

<p>“Some silly mistake!” he exclaimed incredulously.
“No one would be crazy enough to turn down a
fellow like Orr!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Stearns Wilson. “Must be
a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Try it over,” suggested Thurston.</p>

<p>It was irregular and some discussion followed, but
in the end, since every one appeared willing and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Moffit smilingly declined to give a ruling, the vote
was taken a second time, and in silence. Severence
once again surveyed the result, and there was a
troubled tone in his voice as he answered the silently
questioning gaze of the meeting.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” he said. “One black.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” Stuart half started from his chair, but
Mr. Moffit laid a gently restraining hand on him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, that’s a rotten shame!” declared
George Whaley. “What’s the idea?” He appealed
frowningly about the room. “Look at the fellows
we’ve taken in already to-night! I’d like to know
who’s got it in for Orr!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t scowl at me,” growled Thurston.
“I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Same here!” “Nor I!” Several voices disclaimed
until Stearns Wilson rapped sharply on the
desk. “Is there any further business?” he asked.
Stuart again made as if to rise and again Mr.
Moffit’s hand restrained him. Some one moved adjournment,
some one seconded and the meeting was
over. Whaley and Muirgart moved toward Stuart,
but he was already on his feet, making for the door,
his face black with rage. He pushed past them with
a muttered growl. Taking his cap from the table in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
the hall, his gaze unwittingly encountered the face
of Steve Le Gette through the open door and their
eyes met. Le Gette’s countenance seemed to Stuart
to express a triumph at once derisive and amused.
Mr. Moffit called from the doorway an instant later,
but Stuart, already crunching the gravel of the
Principal’s Walk, either did not or pretended not to
hear.</p>

<p>Neil was back in Number 12 when Stuart reached
it, comfortably reclined in a morris chair, reading.
Stuart closed the door behind with a slam and shied
his cap to the bed. “The dirty pup!” he raged.
“The sneaking bounder! But I’ll get even with him
if it takes all the rest of my life! He can’t do that
to me and get away with it!”</p>

<p>Neil’s cheeks went a little white, but he only
smiled as he said: “No use getting mad about it,
Stuart. He had a right to turn me down if he
wanted to, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t, by jingo! He—Look here!”
Stuart paused in his irritable tramping between door
and table. “How’d you know?”</p>

<p>“Must have guessed it from your manner,”
laughed Neil. “How many were there against me?”</p>

<p>“One, but that was enough. It was Steve Le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Gette, the dirty dog. He doesn’t like me, but that’s
no reason to take it out on you! Just because I put
your name up——”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was Le Gette?” Neil looked
puzzled. “Why, I don’t even know him, except
by sight! Why should he—he——”</p>

<p>“Because he wanted to get at me, I tell you! But
I’ll get <em>him</em>, Neil, as sure as shooting!”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you he did it?”</p>

<p>“Tell me? Of course he didn’t! He wouldn’t
have had the courage to tell it! But he looked it.
It was on his ugly face from the moment I got there.
I half suspected it, but I couldn’t quite think he’d do
it, even if he wanted to. Every one there was so—so
astonished they wouldn’t believe it! We took the
vote over! If you’d seen the sneering, rotten look
he gave me afterwards! I wish I’d punched his
face right then. If Moffit hadn’t been there——”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t,” said Neil quietly. “After
all, it’s rather my affair than it is yours, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Stuart stared in real surprise. It hadn’t occurred
to him before that Neil might be the one to feel it
most. Even now he wasn’t ready to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot,” he declared. “The insult
was to me. He’s got nothing against you, couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
have. If any one else had proposed you he wouldn’t
have cared. If I’d realized I’d have had Thirsty or
Whaley do it. I’m not through yet, though. I’ll
get you in next term, you can bet!”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I’d want you to,” said Neil
doubtfully. “Isn’t there something a little—well, a
little degrading about coming back like that after
you’ve been shown once that you aren’t wanted?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! Look here, Neil, every fellow there
wanted you in, and they were all as surprised and—and
mad as I was! You bet I’ll try again! And
I’ll make it go, too! When I get through with Le
Gette he won’t know a black ball from a white!”</p>

<p>“I’d lots rather you just let the whole thing drop,”
said Neil earnestly. “Taking revenge on Le Gette
isn’t worth while. Besides, being blackballed isn’t—well,
it isn’t altogether pleasant, and I’d a heap
rather not have it talked about, and all that, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to talk about it,” answered Stuart
grimly. Then, after a moment, getting Neil’s point
of view, he added: “It’s nonsense to feel that way
about it, though, old chap. Lots of fellows are
turned down for Lyceum or Manning without any
one thinking anything about it. And, gee, some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
fellows get three and four black balls against them!
Every one there to-night knows that it was just
spite-work. You don’t need to let it worry you one
mite.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I’d rather you didn’t go after Le
Gette, Stuart, if you don’t mind very much. In the
first place, you have no real proof——”</p>

<p>“Proof enough,” growled the other.</p>

<p>“And in the second place, it’ll just make talk.
Let’s forget it.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life! There won’t be any talk,
Neil, but Le Gette will know that I’ve settled with
him!”</p>

<p>Neil said no more. He believed that by morning
Stuart would have calmed down somewhat. And it
wasn’t wise to oppose Stuart beyond a certain point,
anyway. He just got more set in his notions.
Stuart returned to the subject several times before
sleep settled down over Number 12.</p>

<p>Had Stuart encountered Le Gette the next forenoon
there would probably have been an explosion;
perhaps blows. But, as luck had it, he didn’t, and
by eleven-thirty, at which time an open hour fell to
him, he had thought of a better, more subtle method
of revenge. He went into the village and found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Mr. Haynes. The coach, sitting in his shirt-sleeves
by an open window of his living room, listened
silently to the tale. When Stuart had reached the
end of his eloquence he lighted his briar again and
said: “Too bad, Harven. Possibly, though, you’ll
be able to make it the next time. From what I hear,
this chap Orr is too fine a fellow to be treated like
that.”</p>

<p>“He’s a corker,” declared Stuart stoutly. “Yes,
I’ll make it the next time all right, Mr. Haynes, but
it’s this time that I’m talking about.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, was there something you wanted
from me? I’m afraid I’m not in a position to be
much help to you, as much as I’d like to.”</p>

<p>“Why, I came to you because I wanted you to
know just what a rotter Le Gette is! I’m not
going to have that sort of a fellow on the team, sir.
We don’t want his kind. The others wouldn’t if
they knew. Of course, I’m not going to tell it
around. It’ll get around without my telling, anyway.
I just wanted you to understand what the
reason was, Mr. Haynes.”</p>

<p>The coach blew a cloud of smoke from his lips
and through it viewed Stuart in a puzzled fashion.
“Let me get this right, Captain Harven,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
after a moment. “Am I to understand that you’re
proposing to—well, dispense with Le Gette’s services
on the team?”</p>

<p>Stuart looked surprised, too. “Of course! I
propose to fire him! What else is there to do? A
fellow like Le Gette isn’t fit for the team. That’s
what I’m here about.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Mr. Haynes was silent for the better
part of a minute, while Stuart watched him with
dawning suspicion. Then: “I don’t think the
position you take is tenable, Captain Harven,” he
said gently. “Because a private quarrel exists between
you and Le Gette you propose to deprive the
squad of a very clever player. Now——”</p>

<p>“The quarrel has nothing to do with it,” replied
Stuart impatiently. “I can look after my own
quarrels. But Le Gette did a sneaky, contemptible
act. Don’t you see that? A football team is—is—well,
in a way it’s a society, Mr. Haynes, a club. It
has its social side as well as its other, and we don’t
want to have dealings with a fellow like Le Gette, a
fellow that will make a personal matter the excuse
for harming one whom he doesn’t even know.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you aren’t making this a personal
matter, too? Are you sure it’s because you want to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
guard the members of the team from the contaminating
influence of Le Gette? Or are you merely
trying to get even with him? Better think about
that a minute.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m sore against him,” answered
Stuart resentfully. “I don’t deny that. Any fellow
would be. But, just the same, I’m acting for
the—the welfare——”</p>

<p>“Granting that, though, Captain Harven,” interrupted
the coach, “how do you know that Le Gette
really did what you say he did? As I understand it,
there is no way of telling whether a voter drops in a
black ball or a white ball at your elections. Has Le
Gette acknowledged he voted against Orr?”</p>

<p>“No, not in words. He doesn’t have to. I
<em>know</em>! His looks were enough. Besides, he was
the only one there that could have! The others all
wanted Neil elected.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you’re correct in your assumption,”
said the coach. “There is more than a reasonable
doubt, I’d say, but suppose you are. Do
you seriously ask me to fire Le Gette for this offense
and on this evidence?”</p>

<p>“No, for I’ll fire him myself,” flared Stuart.
“I’m captain of the team, even if being captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
doesn’t amount to much this year! At least, I
fancy, I’ve got the right to say whether or not a
player is fit to be on the team!”</p>

<p>Mr. Haynes shook his head gently. “I doubt
that, Harven.”</p>

<p>“What! Do you mean to say——”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” The coach’s voice was quiet but
very firm, very assured. “I mean, Captain Harven,
that it is the coach’s place to select the players.
That I take to be one of his duties. If he is to instruct
a team in football he certainly has the privilege
of deciding who shall belong to that team; in
other words whom he considers eligible to his instruction.
And if he has the power to choose the
members he must surely have the power to dispense
with them.”</p>

<p>“Where does the captain come in in your
scheme?” sneered Stuart.</p>

<p>“The captain has the duty of leadership,” replied
the coach, without appearance of offense. “The
team selected, he becomes its head, responsible to the
coach for its obedience to his orders and, more than
all, for its morale. There should be close and
frank coöperation between captain and coach. The
captain undoubtedly should occupy an advisory position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
in all matters pertaining to the team. He
should act as a liaison officer between the players
and the coach. I am sorry that coöperation between
us so far this season hasn’t amounted to much.
From the first, rightly or wrongly, I have observed
an attitude of resentment in you toward me. I
have said nothing, in the hope that it would pass, in
the trust that you would soon set aside any slight
personal dislike of me that you had and meet me
fairly and frankly halfway. But this you don’t
seem inclined to do. I’ll acknowledge that the matter
of the training table was unfortunate, but I think
that, were you perfectly fair to me, you would acknowledge
that no offense was meant and sponge it
off the slate, Harven. Wait, please: let me finish.
There can’t be divided authority in the running of a
football team any more than there can be in any
other effort toward success. It is best to have the
duties of your office and mine clearly defined for our
mutual understanding. I am paid a salary—two
thousand dollars, to be exact—to come here and do
my level best to turn out a winning football team.
As I understand it, I am responsible only to the
Committee on Athletics and, under them, am in full
command. I couldn’t do the work justice if matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
were any different, Harven. You have been chosen
the captain of the team, an intermediary between the
players and the coach. Your authority does not extend
beyond that of any other member of the team
<em>outside</em> the team. To grant you the right to select
and discharge players would be fatal to my authority.
You would become the court of last resort and
your word would be law, not mine. I couldn’t work
under those conditions. Surely you must see that,
Captain Harven.”</p>

<p>“Until this year the captain has had an equal say
with the coach in the affairs of the team,” answered
Stuart hotly. “Until you came there was never any
question as to who had authority or who hadn’t!”</p>

<p>“And until this year you were not captain,” replied
Mr. Haynes coldly. “I’m sorry, Harven. I
wish things had turned out differently. Perhaps
I’m not wholly free from blame, but, frankly, I
don’t know how to handle you, my boy. I hope
we’ll come together presently. Meanwhile I’m here
for just one thing. You know what that is. And
I propose to accomplish that thing. I want your
help, need it badly, but, with it or without it, I’m
going to be coach of this team and hold the reins.”</p>

<p>Stuart jerked to his feet and stared down on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
host with white face and angry eyes. “You refuse
to fire Le Gette, then?” he demanded tensely.</p>

<p>“I do, Captain Harven. I refuse most decidedly.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I say, then, that I won’t work on the
team with him?”</p>

<p>“You can’t,” answered the coach earnestly.
“You have a duty to the school, just as I have toward
my employer. Clashes between you and me,
my boy, must not be allowed to damage the prospects
of the team. We’ll fight our battles together
off the field and not, as you say Le Gette did, make
the innocent suffer.”</p>

<p>Stuart’s eyes fell, but the hostility was still in his
voice as he answered: “All right, sir. I’m just
as keen as you are for having Manning win this year.
You needn’t lay all the blame on me, though, for not
coöperating. You treated me rotten from the first.
I shan’t forget that. I guess you’ve got the
Athletic Faculty behind you, so there’s nothing for
me to do but lie down and play dead! I’m not going
to fight you. If I asked for a show-down I guess
the team would be on my side, all right, but I’m not
playing baby. I’ll see it through because it’s my
team as much as it is yours, even if you don’t think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
so. There’s one thing, though, I’m promising myself,
Mr. Haynes. When the season’s over I’m
going to give myself the satisfaction of telling you
just what I think of you!”</p>

<p>“When the season’s over I’ll be ready to hear it,
Captain Harven,” answered the coach quietly.</p>

<p>Stuart went out wishing mightily that slamming
the door would not be beneath his dignity.</p>

<p class="cap">No one learned of that conversation in the
coach’s quarters but Neil. And Neil, although
he said little, was, in Stuart’s opinion,
none too sympathetic. Which, of course,
means that Neil didn’t approve of his chum’s course
and couldn’t conceal the fact. Stuart was sensible
of a slight disappointment in Neil this fall. The
latter didn’t seem nearly so sympathetic as last year,
he thought. Somewhat moodily he listened to
Neil’s plea for concord and patience, at last replying
rather testily:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. I know where I stand and I’m
going to take my medicine. Haynes has the upper
hand and, short of taking the matter to the Ath.
Fac., there’s nothing I can do. And I guess the Ath.
Fac., would back Haynes against me, as far as
that goes. He’s being paid a salary for his job, and
I’m not. They’d do as he said if only to get their
money’s worth. As for Le Gette——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>He stopped, and Neil said anxiously: “Better
forget all about him, Stuart. There’s nothing you
can do, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“There’s plenty I <em>can</em> do,” answered the other
grimly, “but I’m not going to. Haynes is
right about one thing, and I’m fair enough to say so.
The team’s success is the main consideration.
I’ll work as hard for that as he will, confound
him!”</p>

<p>To Stuart’s credit it may be said that he honestly
meant that and earnestly tried to live up to the
promise. If he didn’t wholly succeed it was not for
lack of good intention. Between him and Le Gette
ensued a period of armed neutrality. Stuart heroically
resisted the temptation to tell Le Gette what
he thought of him, promising himself, however, the
pleasure of doing so after Pearsall had been disposed
of. It was in his power to make Le Gette’s
path to the first team more difficult of travel, perhaps,
by underhand machinations, to keep him off it
entirely, but he had no thought of that. At work
they spoke when they had to. At other times they
passed without greetings. Jack riled Stuart one
day by declaring that Le Gette seemed to him to be
rather a decent chap. “Of course I don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
him,” he added. “I’m only judging by what I’ve
seen of him at the field.”</p>

<p>“You know what he did to Neil, don’t you?” asked
Stuart hotly.</p>

<p>“Y-yes, but—well, honestly, Stuart, I’ve always
thought there might have been a mistake there.”</p>

<p>“There was,” replied the other dryly, “and he’ll
find it out some day!”</p>

<p>On the seventh, Manning defeated Wentworth,
7 to 0, in a close, well-played contest, and there began
to be talk of getting through the season without
being scored against. A week later such talk ended
abruptly. On the Tuesday succeeding the Wentworth
game the Cherry-and-Gray met her first misfortune.
Leo Burns, already picked as the likeliest
of the halfbacks, sprained his ankle in practice. It
was a bad sprain, with no chance of recovery in time
for the Walsenburg game, and Stuart’s confidence
in the team’s ability to win that contest had a setback.
Of course it was no life-or-death matter, but
he wanted that game very much. Walsenburg
was a stout adversary who had thrown several scares
into Manning during the last few years, but had
beaten her but once. Stuart knew that Walsenburg
was thirsting for Manning blood and even suspected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
her of duplicity in securing an early date. Also,
there existed a slight feeling of rivalry between him
and the Walsenburg quarter. All in all, Stuart
would rather have won that contest than any other
on the schedule, with, of course, the exception of
the big game with Pearsall. He tentatively mentioned
splints and bandages to The Laird, but
The Laird was emphatically opposed to taking
chances.</p>

<p>“He’d be little use, Cap, in the game,” he declared,
“and if he was hurt again he’d be out for the season.
Yes, I know he’s keen for playing, but there’s other
games coming and we’ll need him worse than we’ll
need him next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any game coming, except Pearsall,
that I’d rather win,” replied Stuart dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Nor me,” agreed the trainer. “They’re a hard,
corky bunch of lads, but maybe we’ll down them just
the same.”</p>

<p>“That’s likely, with Haynes making no effort for
them,” said Stuart bitterly. “He isn’t even giving
us a new play! We’ll have to face them with the
same stuff we had last year, and they’ll eat it up,
Laird!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Stuart hadn’t given up all hope, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
even though Coach Haynes had decided to make no
special preparations for Walsenburg, he knew that
there was a strong sentiment among the players in
favor of beating the rival at almost any cost, and he
was relying on that sentiment to pull the team
through. It was evident as early as the first of that
week that no help was to be expected from Mr.
Haynes. He had more than once declared himself
against disturbing the early season progress of the
team for the purpose of beating an opponent.
“We’ll take them in our stride,” was his way of expressing
it. There was not a little criticism and
some grumbling from the veterans, but the new
coach had by now pretty firmly established himself
in their favor, and openly expressed opposition to his
decision was lacking.</p>

<p>Ernest Lowe took Burns’ place at left half and
practice went on methodically until Friday. On
Friday evening Coach Haynes did call a session in
the gymnasium and gave them nearly an hour of
floor practice on formations and some ten minutes
of good advice, but that was the extent of his concessions.
And the next day, when the line-up was
made known, he had, at least in the judgment of
most, neutralized that by putting Steve Le Gette in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
at right tackle in place of Ned Thurston. Le
Gette had been playing a good game as substitute,
and Thurston had, it was true, been under his form
since the Wentworth contest, but those who knew
“Thirsty” were convinced of his ability to come
back and were far from pleased with the change.
Stuart closed his lips very tight and said nothing
when the list was read, but on the way to the field
he confided to Jack bitterly that “Walsenburg ought
to lick us, with our own coach doing all he can to
help her!”</p>

<p>From a Manning viewpoint the game left much
to be desired. Looking at it from the Walsenburg
side of the field, it was a corker! Walsenburg’s
players were probably no better individually than the
opponent’s, but collectively they were just as much
better as the final score proclaimed them: and the
final score was 13 to 6.</p>

<p>Walsenburg had developed team play to a remarkable
point, considering the time of year. Sticking to
quite simple plays, starting from a three-abreast formation,
Walsenburg relied on speed, weight and
smoothness of operation to win. The Cherry-and-Gray
was put on the defensive early in the first
quarter and kept there until the half was over, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
the enemy twice rushed her way to the home team’s
threshold, the first time losing the ball on downs on
the eight yards and the second time plunging across
the line for a touchdown that was followed by a goal.
In the third quarter Manning staged a come-back,
and securing the pigskin on her own twenty-two
yards she mingled two forward-passes with an end-running
attack that, aided by a penalty for holding,
placed her within scoring distance of the adversary’s
goal.</p>

<p>After that it was only grim determination that enabled
her to put the ball over, for her plays, none of
them new, were “old stuff” to Walsenburg and were
as often stopped behind the line as beyond it. It
was individual brilliancy versus team play, with the
odds all in favor of the latter, and yet for once the
probabilities were upset, for, from the visitor’s
twenty-seven to her six, big, calm-eyed “Howdy”
Tasker, at fullback, smashed his way in four attempts,
once plunging for five yards outside left
tackle quite on his own, the interference having been
nailed in its tracks. From the six, Manning ground
down the defense by concentrating on the Walsenburg
right guard, throwing Tasker and Hanson at
him, and then Tasker again, and gaining a yard, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
yard and a half and another yard. On fourth down
slightly over six feet of trampled turf remained to
be conquered, and, with Manning imploring from
the stand, Tasker again hurled himself at Walsenburg’s
right guard and Stuart, the ball snuggled to
his stomach, shot off to the right, head down, and
plunged some how through the mêlée until, falling,
his hands held the pigskin just over the last white
line.</p>

<p>Stuart failed at goal by less than the width of the
ball and Manning groaned dismay and sorrow, for
at this stage of the contest it seemed that the home
team might hold the enemy from further scoring.
But, although Walsenburg appeared content to mark
time for the rest of the period, in the last quarter she
again showed her power. Tasker’s weak punt from
his thirty-five to midfield gave the adversary her
chance and she set herself to the task with new
energy. She had freshened her backfield with a
pair of substitute halfs and began a ferocious, remorseless
hammering of the Manning right side.
Towne was worn down and gave way to Baker, and
Le Gette, who had performed creditably at right
tackle, was replaced by Thurston. But the enemy
had almost gained his objective by that time and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
ready to shift his attack. A crafty forward-pass,
as well performed as it was unexpected, placed the
ball on the home team’s seventeen yards for first
down. A fake place kick developed into a quarterback
run around left end, and, although Stuart
brought down his rival well across the field, the pigskin
was four yards closer to the goal line. From
the thirteen yards Walsenburg reached the five in
three plunges through a weakening line. There
Manning braced and wrenched the ball from the
enemy by inches and Tasker punted from behind his
line. But again the ball went short and a Walsenburg
halfback caught on Manning’s twenty-three
and dodged back to the fourteen.</p>

<p>Tasker and Lowe were taken out and fresh backs
sent in. Cutts, at center, was also replaced. But
Walsenburg was not to be denied. A double pass
fooled Manning badly, three plunges at the new
center yielded gains and once more the enemy was inside
the five-yard line. The Cherry-and-Gray cohorts
hoarsely pounded out their slogan of “<em>Hold,
Manning! Hold, Manning!</em>” but Manning was a
played-out team now and there was little glory for
the visitor in her final triumph. Two plays took the
pigskin across, the second through a hole big enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
for a push-cart to pass and Manning tasted the
bitterness of defeat.</p>

<p>That game, though it ended in disaster for Manning,
was, after all, nothing to hang one’s head
over. Against a far-better developed team, the
Cherry-and-Gray had fought desperately and often
heroically, and this fact, when the first sting of disappointment
had worn off, was recognized by the
school. In fact, the <cite>Bulletin</cite>, the school weekly, was
quite epic in its editorial the following Thursday,
and likened the battle to Thermopylae, and the home
team to Greek heroes. It praised Captain Harven
highly for his generalship and individual playing,
which praise was certainly well deserved, and it
spoke in glowing measure of several others: Tasker
and Towne and Cutts and Whaley; and even
dripped honeyed words on Le Gette. Perhaps the
<cite>Bulletin</cite> overdid it somewhat, but it meant well.</p>

<p>One person who appeared neither depressed or
elated over the result of the Walsenburg contest was
Coach Haynes. He placed criticism where it was
merited and commendation where deserved, and set
his face toward the Forest Hill game with no sign
of disturbance on it. He seemed quite satisfied and,
certainly, voiced no regrets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>But Stuart took that defeat badly. Perhaps without
realizing it, he had half believed the optimists
who had a week before bravely predicted a clean
slate for the season. I don’t think he allowed his
hopes to dwell on the possibility of the team getting
through without being scored on: that was less a
possibility than an impossibility, but he had dared
hope for a season of no defeats. He believed, and
was justified in believing, that had Coach Haynes
given the team even three days of preparation for
the Walsenburg contest it might at least have
emerged from it with a tied score. He had no sympathy
for the coach’s contention that a defeat was
sometimes good medicine. At least, he didn’t believe
that true of a team of which he was captain.
It might be so other years.</p>

<p>Stuart’s dissatisfaction was increased by the reflection
that, so far as public opinion was concerned,
he had failed to show any superiority over the rival
quarterback. Naturally, since the other had played
on the winning side, his work appeared more
brilliant. Stuart tried to comfort himself with the
assurance that, man for man, he had shown a little
more than the Walsenburg quarter, but, lacking the
confirmation of public opinion, that assurance didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
make him happy. He laid his failure to win the decision
over his rival to Mr. Haynes, thus increasing
by just so much more his account against the coach.</p>

<p>Stuart spoke his mind very freely to all save Mr.
Haynes. Between him and the coach there existed
an armistice, respectful, but no more. Stuart
avoided private converse with the other, and at the
conferences, held twice, occasionally thrice, a week
in the coach’s quarters, he maintained an aloof attitude
that, while it had no apparent disturbing
effect on Mr. Haynes, created a disquieting atmosphere
of which the others were dimly aware. It is
doubtful if Stuart realized how evident his antagonism
was; doubtful, too, if, had he realized it, he
could have disguised it, for his resentment still
burned very deeply. Stuart took his grievance to
the players and found sympathetic ears. Most of
the fellows held that it would not have hurt the progress
of the team if the coach had allowed them to
take or tie the Walsenburg game, and a few still
nursed dissatisfaction as late as the following Monday.
Most of them, however, were willing to let
bygones be bygones by then, and were inclined to be
bored when Stuart reverted to the subject. They
liked Stuart, were proud of him as a captain, credited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
him with the brilliance as a player which he
thoroughly deserved, but when it came to a question
of leadership they preferred to put their trust in
Hop Haynes. Stuart was all right, but—well, he
was liable to fly off the handle if any one tried to interfere
with his methods or question his opinions,
and, after all, a football team needed a steady hand
on the lines. That was the general opinion among
the fellows, although there remained a handful
whose personal allegiance to Stuart would have
stood them up in front of a firing squad at sunrise
if he had led the way. Among the latter was Jack
Brewton. Jack however, was not ignorant of his
friend’s shortcomings. Rather, he realized them
very thoroughly and put his faith in Stuart in spite
of them. While he would have stepped at once to
Stuart’s side and had an actual breach between captain
and coach transpired, he would have gone with
his eyes open, and while he was sympathetic toward
his friend’s feelings he did not hesitate to say what
he honestly thought, as, on Monday.</p>

<p>“It would have been bully to win that game,
Stuart, but Haynes is the Big Boss, you know, and
his business is training football teams. He evidently
thought it would be better not to put out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
effort, and it’s only fair to assume that he was right.
The school’s paying him real money for what he’s
doing and all we can do is believe that he’s worth his
salary; at least until he shows he isn’t. And if we
believe that, we’ve got to believe he was right about
Saturday’s game. Q. E. D., or words to that
effect.”</p>

<p>“Because you pay a coach a salary it doesn’t
signify that he’s got all the wisdom of Solomon or
Walter Camp,” objected Stuart. “We could have
trained a week to meet Walsenburg and still been
ready for Forest Hill next Saturday. Forest Hill
isn’t dangerous; and even if she were, any of us
would rather have lost to her than to Walsenburg.
Haynes has got you fellows hypnotized. All he
has to do is strike an attitude and look wise and you
all say ‘A-ah!’”</p>

<p>Jack threw an arm over Stuart’s shoulders and
shook him gently. “Listen, old thing, you’re heading
for trouble, and I wish you wouldn’t. Just forget
your grouch against Haynes and see how things
turn out. If he hands us a victory over Pearsall
you’ll be one of the first to forgive and forget.
Better do it now and make that victory more certain.
Some of the fellows are talking already. They say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
you don’t care what happens to the team so long as
you can make faces at Haynes. Of course that isn’t
so. The old crowd understands, but there’s a bunch
of new chaps around who are getting gabby. Now,
wipe off the slate, Stuart, and start over. We’re all
after success for the team. Just let’s think of that
and nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.” Stuart was silent a moment.
Then he added: “It’s easy enough for you chaps,
but—but I’m captain! Hang it, what’s the good of
having a captain if he hasn’t any more authority
than a third string substitute? Since the season
started I haven’t had a voice in one single decision
that’s been made! I’m sick of it, I tell you! For
two cents I’d throw it up! I would, by gosh!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you wouldn’t,” said Jack soothingly.
“You’re not the sort to desert under fire, old man.
Come on and I’ll play you fifty points at billiards
before math.”</p>

<p>Stuart allowed himself to be dragged to Meigs
where, perhaps not without some connivance on
Jack’s part, he ran out twelve points to the good.</p>

<p>After three weeks of trial, the plan of doing without
the training table appeared to be a success. At
first some of the new candidates took advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
their freedom and ate not wisely but too well, but
they soon discovered that it didn’t work. The Laird
had an eagle’s eye for physical condition, and when
a warning wasn’t sufficient a day or two on the
bench—and a four-lap jog of the track—brought
the offender around. Even Stuart was obliged to
confess that the new plan was working satisfactorily,
although he made the confession without great enthusiasm
and only to The Laird. He and The Laird
were very close friends, and he could make admissions
of this sort to him.</p>

<p>A week of hard practice followed the Walsenburg
game and then Manning met Forest Hill School and
won decisively, 27 to 3, and the season was half
over.</p>

<small>THE ATH. FAC. TAKES A HAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Before the Forest Hill game was a thing of
the past, however, the dissensions between
coach and captain had produced the inevitable
result. There was a feeling of disquiet and apprehension
among the players that showed itself in
little but unmistakable ways and, while as yet it
showed no apparent effect on their work, threatened
to impair their morale sooner or later. There was a
good deal of talk, a good deal of discussion, and the
fellows began to take sides. Five or six of the
veterans honestly considered that Mr. Haynes had
been and still was conducting the affairs of the team
in a high-handed manner, and while they credited
him with the best of intentions they still held that
Stuart was “getting a raw deal.” To these faithful
supporters were added a few others who, caring
little about the merits of the case, loved a scrap for
its own sake. To be fair to Stuart it should be said
that, if he did little to prevent this situation, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
at least did nothing intentionally to produce it.
When he found that the players were actually beginning
to take sides he saw the danger and, not hypocritically,
declared that “Haynes was boss and it was
up to them all to obey orders and not shoot off their
mouths.” That, though, only brought knowing
looks. Of course Stuart would talk like that: he
would feel that he had to!</p>

<p>The other side hinted disagreeably that the captain
had a swelled head; that he always had had and that
it was bigger than ever since he had been made captain:
and that any fellow who couldn’t get along
with a chap like Mr. Haynes was a natural-born
grouch. Stuart found support and sympathy in an
unsuspected quarter in the shape of manager Fred
Locker. Locker had nothing against the coach personally,
but he had spent three years at Manning and
had seen things done differently, and, while he had
nothing to say publicly, he let Stuart know his sentiments.
He talked to Jack one evening, too, but he
quickly agreed with the latter that, whoever was in
the right, Stuart mustn’t be allowed to “mess things
up and make a fool of himself.” The main thing,
of course, was to lick Pearsall and it was every
fellow’s duty to work for that result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>In the Forest Hill game Stuart played as well as
he ever had, although the incentive to great effort
was lacking since the contest was one-sided from the
first. On Monday, however, when the first was
stacked up against the second and Saturday’s players
were, contrary to custom, sent into the scrimmage,
Stuart was distinctly off his game. Scenting an opportunity
to triumph, perhaps, the second, coached
by Mr. Webster, who had long since earned the affectionate
nickname of “Old Unabridged,” started
in with a whoop. Several of the fellows on the first
team who had played through the Forest Hill game
slightly resented being called on to-day. Some of
them were a little bit tired, or thought they were,
which amounts to practically the same thing.
Among them was Stuart. His resentment was
principally aimed at the violation of a long-established
precedent which allowed those who had played
through a Saturday game a Monday of rest or, at
the most, the lightest sort of labor. He didn’t much
mind playing, although, as he explained later to Neil,
he “didn’t feel very zippy,” but the injustice rankled.
As a result he—well, he was pretty poor.</p>

<p>Second took the kick-off and came up the field
hard, using a new split-formation play that “Old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Unabridged” had just taught them, to such good results
that they were on the first’s twenty-yard line
before any one knew what was happening. After
that they tried twice to bore through the center and
then tried to heave across the left. Tom Muirgart
spoiled that, however, catching the ball just short of
the line, and the first lined up on her three yards.
Stuart called for a plunge at center, which yielded
practically nothing, and then, instead of letting
Tasker punt out of danger, himself took the ball for
a run around the right. In the situation that was as
unexpected a play as it was hazardous. Perhaps
Stuart expected its unexpectedness to make it go,
but if he did he was wrong. A big second team
tackle slammed through and got him before he could
turn in and heaved him across the goal line for a
safety.</p>

<p>Some of his companions looked on him sorrowfully
and reproachfully, though only half in earnest.
Coach Haynes spoke his mind quietly but crisply.
“Bad generalship, Captain Harven,” he said, as
Stuart found his feet again. “Too risky. You
should have punted.”</p>

<p>Stuart, knowing all that quite as well as the coach,
scowled and bit his lip. The coach, about to add<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
something further, caught his expression and wisely
changed his mind.</p>

<p>The second chose to kick-off and the pigskin
floated high and far toward the first team goal.
Stuart claimed it and got under it near the ten-yard
line. The catch was not a difficult one. The other
backs, never doubting that he would make it, sped
ahead to form interference. The ball fell straight
into Stuart’s hands and as straightly bounded out
again. He tried to get it on the bounce as it went
on toward the goal line, failed, and threw himself on
it. Again misfortune met him. The ball somehow
wiggled loose and a second team end, who had
marvelously evaded the interference, crashed down
across Stuart and captured the pigskin.</p>

<p>From the seven yards the second carried over in
four plays, choosing Towne as a point of attack.
Although she failed at goal, the second had, beyond
any possible doubt, won the game in the first six
minutes of play, and she rejoiced exceedingly and
made herself most obnoxious; so much so that Billy
Littlefield came to blows with a second team end and
was yanked out by a stern referee. Stuart, sore and
silent, followed back to position to find Millard
Wheaton awaiting him. “Wheat” was trying hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
to look regretful, but the attempt wasn’t very successful.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Stuart darkly.</p>

<p>“You’re off,” said Wheaton. “Sorry, Cap.”</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” Stuart pulled his head guard
on with a jerk.</p>

<p>Wheaton, at a loss, turned to Tasker, but Howdy
only shrugged. Of course his duty was to call the
referee’s attention to Stuart’s refusal, but—well,
Stuart was captain of the team, and so, after a
moment’s indecision, Wheaton trotted back to the
side-line. Then Mr. Haynes walked out with
Wheaton in tow. Stuart, seeing, went toward them.</p>

<p>“Captain Harven,” said the coach firmly but
quietly, “I sent Wheaton in to take your place.”</p>

<p>“I intend to stay in, sir,” answered Stuart doggedly.
“This is a practice game and a boob play or
two don’t matter.”</p>

<p>“I think differently. Kindly do as I say. We
can discuss the matter later.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! I’m captain and I’m within my rights,
Mr. Haynes. I’m going to play this period out.
It wasn’t fair to work us to-day, anyhow. Some of
us are done up. If we make mistakes it’s because
we oughtn’t to be here at all. You can put Wheat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
in the next period if you like, but he doesn’t play
quarter now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Haynes looked a bit white, but he only nodded
and turned on his heel. Then: “Come on,
Wheaton,” he said, and led the way back to the side
line. Stuart was aware that the other fellows were
very carefully avoiding looking at him. Harmon
broke the silence and the tension with a cheerful
“Come on, First! Let’s get ’em!” and the whistle
piped.</p>

<p>Stuart played the twelve-minute period out, as he
had said he would, and played very raggedly, although
there were no more glaring mistakes.
When the teams went off, second still holding her
13 to 0 lead, Stuart tried hard to look nonchalant
and smiling and accepted the blanket that The Laird
tossed him with a joking remark. The Laird,
though, shook his head gently. Stuart froze up and
watched the rest of the scrimmage in silence.</p>

<p>He had plenty of time for second thought before
the final whistle blew and the first team trailed off to
the gymnasium smarting under a 13 to 7 defeat, and
in that time he decided that he had, in the accommodating
language of the baseball diamond, “pulled
a boner.” He firmly believed himself to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
justified in his refusal to accept dismissal from the
line-up. That didn’t trouble him. His mistake had
been, he concluded, in insisting on his right to remain.
It would have been better in every way had
he protested with dignity and gone off the field. He
would have had the sympathy of his team mates,
avoided the possible charge of insubordination and
added further evidence of the coach’s high-handedness.
As it was, he had the uncomfortable
conviction that he had made himself appear ridiculous
rather than heroic. These reflections were no
aid to composure and peace of mind, and, although
he wanted to convey the impression that the incident
had left him undisturbed, no one was deceived by
his studied attempt at nonchalance. He took pains
not to avoid Mr. Haynes, but did not seek to reopen
the discussion. For his part, the coach, rather
graver than usual, seemed to have dismissed the
matter from his mind.</p>

<p>Stuart went back to Lacey from the gymnasium
and recounted the incident to Neil. He treated it
lightly, even flippantly, but under the lightness was
an unconscious note of defiance. He didn’t expect
Neil to altogether approve of his action, but it was
typical of him that he always did tell Neil things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
whether he looked for commendation or censure.
Perhaps this was largely because the other’s judgments,
for or against, were invariably frank and
honest. When Stuart had ended, Neil smiled and
shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I’m going to do with you,
Stuart,” he sighed. “You do mess things up frightfully!”</p>

<p>“What about others?” asked Stuart in injured
tones. “Who started the trouble to-day?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goop,” begged Neil. “If some one
shies a brick at you, is there any reason why you
can’t side step it? Whether you realize it or not,
you’ve been trying to make out a case against Mr.
Haynes ever since you got here. Of course, that’s
poor business, but if you must do it, why do everything
you can to spoil it? No matter who was in
the right to-day, and I’m not enough of a football
man to know, your cue was instant obedience.
Then, if there was any injustice, you’d have had
public opinion on your side. Can’t you see that,
you chump? What happened afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. He didn’t open his mouth, and so I
didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You better, though,” said Neil earnestly. “See<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
him this evening and make some sort of an apology.”</p>

<p>“I will like fun!” exclaimed Stuart indignantly.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to,” Neil replied firmly. “You can
insist all you please on your rights in the matter, but
you must own up that you acted wrongly. You did,
you know. That was a poor example to set the
rest of the team, Stuart.”</p>

<p>The other was glumly, rebelliously silent for a
minute. Then: “Of course I did the wrong
thing,” he acknowledged grudgingly. “Seems to
me I’m always doing it where Haynes is concerned.
He gets my goat, confound him! I had a good case
against him to-day and I spoiled it, just as you say.
I won’t go over to his rooms and lick his boots,
Neil, but I’ll call him on the telephone after supper.”</p>

<p>Neil considered a moment doubtfully. After all,
even that was quite a concession from Stuart, and so
he nodded. “All right, but be decent, Stuart.
Don’t talk haughty.”</p>

<p>“All right, but I won’t apologize: understand
that! I’ll say I was wrong in staying in after he
told me to come out, but I <em>won’t</em> say that I didn’t
have a perfect right to!”</p>

<p>But after supper, although Stuart went twice to
the telephone downstairs, Mr. Haynes didn’t respond,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
and so that near-apology wasn’t made.
There was much talk that evening among the players
and even Stuart’s stanchest upholders could find no
good excuse for him. The best they could do was
plead extreme provocation; and even that was challenged
by the opposition. By the next day the
school in general had hold of the story and there
were many and varied versions of what had actually
happened. The most sensational story had it that
blows had been exchanged between coach and captain.
The school in general stood loyally behind the
captain, for, especially amongst the younger boys, he
was looked up to as a hero. Junior class fellows
viewed his progress across the campus that morning
with an admiration so evident as to make Stuart uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Returning from a recitation at eleven, he found
an envelope in his box bearing the inscription,
“Manning School, Safford, Conn. Committee on
Athletics.” Communications from the Athletic
Faculty, usually on routine matters, were no unusual
affairs, and Stuart slipped the letter into his pocket
with no disturbing premonition and only slight curiosity.
In fact, it was not until he had been in
Number 12 for several minutes and had settled down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to dig for an impending hour test in English that he
recalled the missive and dug it from his pocket.
Since Neil was at a recitation, Stuart had the room
to himself, something that he was later very thankful
for. He made nothing of the letter at the first
reading, for incredulity turned the phrases into a
meaningless jumble. Then, a puzzled frown between
his eyes, he read it again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">Mr. Stuart Harven,<br>

<p class="noi">Dear Sir:</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Committee on Athletics held
this evening the following Resolution was passed:</p>

<p>“Whereas, in the judgment of this Committee,
Captain Stuart Harven has shown himself unable
or unwilling to act in coöperation with the Coach
in the conduct of the affairs of the Football Team,
which fact this Committee considers detrimental to
the welfare of the Team, it is</p>

<p>“Resolved that Captain Stuart Harven be directed
to appear before this Committee at eight o’clock on
the evening of October 26 and show cause why his
resignation as captain should not be requested for
the good of the Team; and that a copy of this Resolution
be delivered to Captain Stuart Harven.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>A NEW LEADER IS CHOSEN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Amazement slowly gave way to anger.
The thing was so unexpected that for a
while he could not believe it, and the idea
that it was a hoax presented itself. But that theory
vanished speedily and he faced the truth. A sense
of insult, of degradation mastered him and he
crumpled the letter into a ball and hurled it to the
floor. He passed a bad ten minutes, his wrath encompassing
Coach Haynes and the whole Athletic
Faculty. Of the latter, though, it was the student
members, Jud McColl and Stearns Wilson, on whom
his anger fell chiefly. They pretended to be his
friends. He could find excuses for the coach, for
the coach made no secret of his hostility, but McColl
and Stearns had literally betrayed him.</p>

<p>Finally he rescued the letter and smoothed it out
and reread it. It was plain enough, he told himself.
They wanted him to go before them and eat humble
pie, perhaps apologize to Haynes! What they did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
not want was his resignation. No matter if he had
failed, from their point of view, as a captain, he was
still invaluable as a player. There was no one to
take his place at quarter. In spite of their bluff,
they couldn’t do without him, and they knew it!
And he knew it! Stuart laughed mirthlessly. Well,
they’d see! If they expected penitence and apologies
they’d be fooled! He’d call their bluff!</p>

<p>He selected a sheet of school paper and went about
the matter very calmly. When it was finished his
reply was a model of conciseness and, he hoped,
dignity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Stuart Harven acknowledges the receipt of
the Committee’s communication of yesterday and
respectfully tenders his resignation as Captain of
the Football Team.</p>
</div>

<p>He considered delivering it personally at the Office
but in the end put a stamp on the envelope and
dropped it into the box in front of Manning as he
hurried to his next class. He was no longer angry.
He was excited instead, excited and triumphant.
He wondered how the Committee would manage to
crawl out of the hole he had placed them in, and he
chuckled as he pictured the surprise and chagrin with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
which his letter would be received. That the resignation
would be accepted never entered Stuart’s
mind. He might have to make concessions, but if
there was any crawling done, the Ath. Fac. would do
it! He went into the class room in a very cheerful
frame of mind.</p>

<p>It was Neil who caused him his first qualms of
doubt. Neil was distressed and strangely pessimistic.
“You must get that resignation back before
it reaches them,” he declared earnestly. “If you go
to the post-office——”</p>

<p>Stuart shrugged. “You can’t get a letter back
like that. Besides, I don’t want to. I’ve called
their bluff, now let them get out of it the best way
they can!”</p>

<p>“But, Stuart, suppose they don’t want to! Suppose
you’ve played into their hand?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, played into their hand?
You don’t think they really want my resignation, do
you?” Stuart laughed in ridicule. “Not much!
Not unless they think I’d give up the captaincy and
go right on playing. And if they do think that
they’ve got a fine big surprise coming to them!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Neil shook his head troubledly,
“Mr. Haynes is against you, remember, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“So are Jud and Stearns Wilson, and I’m not
likely to forget it, either,” interrupted Stuart in an
ugly tone. “But if it came to a show-down I guess
there are plenty of fellows on the team——”</p>

<p>“Stuart, if the Committee accepts your resignation
the players won’t have anything to say about it!
Don’t you see that? They couldn’t do anything if
they wanted to. If you’d only waited and talked it
over first! I—I’m awfully afraid you’ve messed
things up again!”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! You wait and see, old man. They’ll
be talking mighty small to-morrow. Jud McColl
knows me well enough to tell them that I’m not the
sort to be kicked out of the captaincy and then keep
right on playing for them! Haynes knows it, too.
He’s no fool, if he does act it.”</p>

<p>But in spite of his pretended assurance Stuart began
to wonder secretly if he had, after all, made a
mistake. Haynes had proved pretty conclusively
that he stood strong with the Committee. He began
to consider what would happen if they did the impossible
thing and accepted the resignation. Short
of inciting the team to mutiny, he realized, with a
sinking sensation, that there wasn’t anything he
could do! And, for that matter, it might be that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
the number of fellows on the team who would stand
by him would be too small to cause anything approaching
a mutiny. And, besides that, Stuart
wasn’t sure that he would want a mutiny. That
would be going too far. It would play hob with the
team and, no matter how it resulted, would set them
back badly. After all, even though the confounded
bunch of old women that called themselves the Committee
on Athletics didn’t seem to believe it, the success
of the team was first in his thoughts! Then he
banished doubts. Neil was always more or less of a
pessimist. Of course, maybe it might have been
wiser to have waited and talked it over a bit first, but
it was mighty unlikely that the Ath. Fac. would cut
off its nose to save its face, or, put differently, would
lose a star quarterback to retain its dignity!</p>

<p>There was no apparent knowledge of the Committee’s
letter among the fellows on the field that
afternoon. Evidently the matter was still a secret.
Coach Haynes was the same as usual, formally polite
to Stuart, and the unpleasant incident of yesterday
seemed to have been forgotten. Stuart went at his
work with a resolution to emphasize his value to the
team and played the game with all the dash and
brilliancy of which he was capable. It was one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
his good days and he made the most of it. “Old
Unabridged’s” pets were torn asunder and trampled
on, out-generaled and out-fought, and the first
walked off the field at the end with a 17 to 0 victory.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Stuart to himself, “let them go
ahead and fire me!”</p>

<p>His high spirits, though, failed to lighten Neil’s
gravity.</p>

<p>Jack came over to Number 12 that evening and he
and Stuart talked a good deal of football and a good
deal of other things, and, apparently there was no
cloud in the sky. But Neil didn’t have much to say,
and when rallied by Jack only smiled and answered
that he was far too much awed by so much brilliance
to venture remarks of his own. Stuart, realizing
the real reason for his roommate’s quietness, had
brief moments of uneasiness.</p>

<p>Oddly, when morning came, he awoke with the
feeling of uneasiness vastly increased, and, although
he told himself that there was no cause for anxiety,
he remained nervous all during breakfast and
through his first two classes, and it was with positive
relief that, at half-past eleven, he returned to
Lacey and spied a letter in his box. Up in Number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
12, he hesitated for a long minute before he slit the
envelope. When at last he did so and read the contents
his face paled. After that he sat for many
more minutes, the letter in his hand and his eyes
fixed broodingly on the floor.</p>

<p>It was a very polite missive, almost cordial in
spite of its brevity. It thanked Mr. Stuart Harven
for his communication, appreciated his spirit of
loyalty to the school, accepted his resignation
with regret for the necessity for doing so and hoped
that the incident would not be allowed to affect his
interest in the Team’s success or impair his usefulness.
When Neil came in later Stuart had recovered
his poise. He handed the letter to Neil with a smile
that, if it didn’t deceive Neil, established the attitude
which Stuart was to hold for some time. Neil said
nothing for a moment after he had read the epistle.
When he did speak he only said gravely: “I’m
sorry, Stuart.”</p>

<p>Stuart shrugged. “Why, so am I, in a way,”
he replied with seeming candor. “I guessed
wrong, and no fellow likes to make mistakes. As
for the rest of it, resigning and all that, why, I’m not
sure it isn’t a good thing, Neil. Trying to get along
with Haynes is a good deal of a job, and the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
fellow will find it out. And I’ll miss playing, I suppose,
for awhile.”</p>

<p>Neil nodded. After a moment he said tentatively:
“This oughtn’t to stop you from playing,
Stuart.”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed shortly and mockingly. “Oh, of
course not! I ought to keep right on, eh? Maybe
I could get a job lugging the water pail! Don’t be
a coot, Neil! If I’m not good enough for captain,
I’m not good enough to play quarterback.”</p>

<p>“How about the team, though? This isn’t going
to make you want Pearsall to win, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, but they won’t need me. Wheaton’s a good
man, and once I’m out of his way he’s bound to be a
lot better.” Stuart didn’t sound convincing even
to himself, though, and he added: “Anyway, I’ve
got some pride, Neil, and I’m switched if I’ll go
back there as a private in the ranks to be grinned at
by every whippersnapper of a fourth-string substitute
and lorded over by Haynes! No, by golly,
they’ve got what they wanted and now they can go
ahead and make good. All I say is, whoever the
new captain is I pity him!”</p>

<p>That ended the subject for a while, for during the
next few days it was carefully avoided by both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>The School heard the news that afternoon, and, as
was to be expected, excitement prevailed. On the
whole, however, the thing created less sensation than
Stuart, for one, looked for. Among the players
sides were taken and argument raged, but Stuart’s
partisans were vastly in the minority, and if he had
secretly hoped for anything approaching a protest
against his resignation he was disappointed. His
own attitude in public was one of smiling, half-contemptuous
amusement. He made no charges in
words, no matter what his manner expressed. A
fair sample of his explanations to those who questioned,
was his reply to Greg Trenholme, the baseball
captain.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t get along,” he said. “There was
only one thing to do and I did it.”</p>

<p>Of course there were many who surmised that
Stuart’s resignation had not been offered solely without
suggestion from the Committee on Athletics and
who freely published that surmise, but the truth of it
was never established. Stuart dropped out of the
team and remained away from the field, and what
news he had of football affairs he received from
Jack. Jack was plainly sympathetic and sorry, but
Stuart couldn’t help feeling after the first few days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
that Jack was accepting the situation with surprising
equanimity. The fact was that the unfortunate incident
once accepted, Jack’s principal sensation was
one of relief. Affairs had been going far more
smoothly at the field since Stuart’s departure. The
feeling of tension had disappeared, and, with Coach
Haynes alone in command, the players knew where
they stood. Of course Stuart was missed at
quarter, and there was no one in sight who
promised to more than half fill his shoes, but Jack’s
loyalty to his friend couldn’t disguise for him the
fact that so far as the welfare of the team was concerned
Stuart’s absence was more of a blessing than
a misfortune. He, like Neil and several others,
had suggested that the loss of the captaincy need
not keep Stuart off the team, but with a similar
result.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” laughed Stuart. “When I
quit, I quit. When Haynes appoints a new captain
you won’t need me.”</p>

<p>“What’s Haynes got to do with choosing a captain?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t he going to?” asked the other innocently.
“Who is, then?”</p>

<p>“The players, of course,” answered Jack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
“There’s a meeting called for to-morrow night.
It’ll probably be Howdy Tasker.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you getting it?” asked
Stuart.</p>

<p>“Me? Gosh, I couldn’t captain the team!”</p>

<p>Two days later, Stuart heard the result of the
meeting. “Nobody would accept,” said Jack gloomily.
“We had Howdy nominated and he refused
point-blank. Then we tried to elect Joe Cutts and
then Billy Littlefield, and they lay down on us.
So——”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you nominated?” asked Stuart.</p>

<p>Jack nodded. “Yes, but I wouldn’t make any
kind of a captain. Well, it ended up with no election.
Now, they say, the Ath. Fac. will appoint
some one. No one seems to want it, though.”</p>

<p>“You were a chump not to accept, Jack. Why
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Jack looked uncomfortable. “I told you, didn’t
I?” he growled. “Besides, I wouldn’t want to take
it when—after you——”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed. “I thought that was it,” he said.
“Well, you should have taken it, old man. I’d
rather see you captain than any one. If any one
could get along with Haynes it’s you, I guess. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
you get the chance again you take it and stop being a
silly ass.”</p>

<p>Jack shook his head, “I don’t believe I’d want it,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>That was Sunday morning. Monday Jack sought
Stuart again just before dinner. “Look here,” he
began, plainly embarrassed, “they’ve gone and done
it, the crazy jays.”</p>

<p>“Done what?”</p>

<p>“Appointed me captain. The Ath. Fac. I got
word half an hour ago. Isn’t that the limit?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything to be insulted about,” answered
Stuart. He tried to sound cordial, but he
didn’t succeed. “You’d better accept, I’d say.”</p>

<p>“Fellows tell me I’ve got to,” muttered Jack.
“I’d a heap rather not. It—it seems sort of rotten.
I mean toward you.”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed shortly. “Don’t mind me, Jack.
I’m out of it completely. You wouldn’t do me any
good by refusing.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite sure you wouldn’t mind?” asked
Jack anxiously.</p>

<p>“Absolutely, old son. Go to it!” Stuart
managed to get the right note that time, and Jack
caught it and smiled his relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Well, then, I suppose I’d better,” he said. “I’d
a lot rather you still had the job, though, Stuart, and
I’d hate mightily to take it if—if you didn’t like it.
You know that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Stuart did know it, and appreciation
of Jack’s loyalty made the word sound genuine.
“Some one’s got to be captain of the team, Jack, and
it might as well be you. In fact, you deserve it, old
man, and I’m glad you’ve got it!”</p>

<p>And he really thought he was glad, but after Jack
had gone off, relieved and quite cheerful, he found
himself wondering how much of his friend’s reluctance
had been real and how much feigned. Certainly
he couldn’t blame Jack for wanting the captaincy.
Any fellow would be glad of the honor.
Of course some chaps might have refused under the
circumstances, but perhaps not many. Friendship
didn’t mean an awful lot, after all, to the average
fellow, and possibly he ought to give credit to Jack
for asking him about it before deciding: if, that is,
Jack hadn’t already made up his mind to accept the
captaincy before coming to him! Stuart’s lip curled
a little. He guessed Jack wouldn’t have let the
chance get away from him whether he—Stuart—had
liked it or lumped it!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<small>OUT OF A JOB</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Stuart borrowed some clubs from Fred
Locker and tried to interest himself in golf
and, for several afternoons, with Neil swinging
along beside him on his crutches, haunted the
links. But impatience and ineptness soon proved
too much for a lukewarm enthusiasm and that means
of passing the time was discarded. Stuart relied on
Neil almost pathetically that first week, and the
latter good-naturedly put himself at the disposal of
his chum and tried his best to be of service, neglecting
his studies on many occasions and not infrequently
getting pretty tired in accompanying the
other over the roads or across fields. As nimble as
he was, the crutches hurt cruelly after a while, and
Stuart, trying, it seemed, to escape from the sounds
of punted balls and the cries of the players on the
gridiron, set a lively pace sometimes.</p>

<p>Stuart’s own studies suffered, too, and they could
ill afford to since football duties had left him in none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
too good a standing. On Friday Mr. Moffit summoned
him to his study in Holton and Stuart went
over there dejectedly that evening after supper.
However, the English instructor didn’t prove formidable.
He managed to make the boy talk about
the loss of the captaincy and, perhaps because he
was tired of pretending, Stuart made a clean breast
of the affair, from first to last, finding his audience
sympathetic and obtaining much relief from the confession.</p>

<p>“Harven,” asked Mr. Moffit when Stuart had
ended, “do you recall a conversation we had here one
afternoon before school started?” Mr. Moffit’s
eyes twinkled. “We discussed, among other things
amenability. I think some one had charged you
with a lack of that quality, and we denied the aspersion
with the contempt it deserved and substituted
an over supply of self-dependence.”</p>

<p>Stuart nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that gets us nowhere, does it? One
of the most puerile pursuits that the human creature
indulges in is weeping on the graves of dead actions.
There’s nothing in it, Harven. Just clang the
cemetery gate, stick your hands in your pockets,
pucker your lips and whistle bravely. And then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
tackle the next job. Of course we do learn by past
mistakes—at least we ought to and some of us do—but
there’s nothing to be gained by beating the breast
and putting ashes in the hair. Now then, what are
you doing?”</p>

<p>“Doing?” asked Stuart vaguely.</p>

<p>“Yes. You’re out of football. What’s taking its
place? I’m fairly certain it’s not English A!”</p>

<p>Stuart smiled sheepishly. “I’m sorry about this
morning, sir. I—I didn’t even look at the stuff
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to tell me that,” laughed Mr.
Moffit. “Well, if it isn’t study that’s occupying
your mind and time, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I guess nothing much. I’ve been walking
around. And I tried golf, but——”</p>

<p>“There! I knew you had some intelligence,
Harven!” the instructor beamed. “Golf ought to
be just the thing for you.”</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head. “I’m no good at it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who is? I’m probably the poorest player that
ever swung a club. But I don’t let that worry me.
Not too much, anyhow. I promise myself that
some day I’ll know so much golf that I’ll have to
write a book about it to keep from bursting!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
You’re eighteen—Seventeen, is it? Well, of course
you’re starting perhaps ten years too late, but you’ve
a good chance to make good. My misfortune is
that I never heard of the game until I was nearly
thirty. Got any clubs?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I borrowed some from a fellow.”</p>

<p>“Take mine then. They are in the closet over
there doing nothing. I hate to open the door and
get the reproachful looks they give me! It may be
imagination, Harven, but sometimes when I awake
at night I could swear that I hear them whimpering.
Take them and use them. Break them, if you like.
I’m sure a golf club would rather be broken than
idle!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, sir, but I don’t believe I’ll try it any
more just now. I—I don’t seem to be able to get
my mind on it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Moffit sighed. “You’re right then. Don’t
try golf when you can’t give it every thought. It’s
divided attention on the links that has enriched the
men who make golf balls. Well, if not golf, what
then?”</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head again. “I’ll find something,
sir. I mean to try basket ball later.”</p>

<p>“Don’t wait until later, Harven. Find something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
at once and put your heart into it. Do you row?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not much. I can scull a bit.”</p>

<p>“A pleasant diversion, but not absorbing, I fear.
Well, think it over and tackle something. And
come and see me about the middle of next week and
tell me what it is. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Good! And just one more thing, Harven.
When you go out of here I want to see you put your
shoulders back and hear you whistle!” Mr. Moffit
was on his feet and holding his hand out. Apparently
the interview was at an end, but the subject
of English A had been scarcely touched on, and as
Stuart shook hands he said:</p>

<p>“I’ll try to do better in English, Mr. Moffit. I’m
sorry——”</p>

<p>“Bless you, I didn’t ask you over here to talk
English to you,” interrupted the other heartily. “I
was after the cause, Harven—the effect was apparent.
Come out from under the weeping willows and
hit the sunshine trail, my boy! That’s the first
thing. Then find something to do and do it hard.
After that English A and all the other courses will
pretty nearly look after themselves! Good night.”</p>

<p>Outside, Stuart heard Mr. Moffit’s window go up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
and the instructor’s voice called: “Harven! You’re
not doing it, you know! Shoulders back and
whistle, you duffer!”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed and obeyed.</p>

<p>He met Coach Haynes only twice or thrice in that
week. He made no effort to avoid him, but their
paths seldom crossed. When they did meet they
spoke politely. Rather to his surprise, Stuart found
that his enmity toward the coach was leavened by a
large admixture of respect. The coach, he
reasoned, was an open and avowed foe who had,
when all was said, fought fairly. Some day not far
distant Stuart meant to go to him and tell him just
exactly what he thought of him, but until that
delectable moment he would treat him with the
dignity and respect due one warrior from another.
But toward the Committee on Athletics, faculty and
student members alike, he cherished a dark wrath.
Especially toward Judson McColl and Stearns
Wilson was this anger directed. They, as it seemed
to Stuart, were veritable snakes in the grass. He
got a good deal of unconscious comfort from that
anger and suffered a distinct loss when he was forced
to abandon it. That happened one morning when
toward the end of the week, he met McColl face to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
face in front of the library and, instead of returning
McColl’s friendly “Hi, Stuart!” gave him a
coldly contemptuous look and passed silently on.
Almost any other fellow but the President of the
Student Council would have shrugged his shoulders
and thereafter let Stuart alone, but McColl wasn’t
the sort to do that; which is, perhaps, one reason
why he was President of the Student Council and of
Manning Society. Unexpectedly, Stuart felt himself
grasped by the shoulders and pushed gently but
very, very firmly against the library wall. Judson
McColl regarded him good-humoredly yet sternly.</p>

<p>“Let’s get this right, Stuart,” he said quietly.
“Why the haughty brow and the frozen glare?
Come across, old man.”</p>

<p>Stuart came across promptly, glad of the chance,
and McColl heard him out patiently. Then, however,
he told Stuart things that fairly took the
ground from under Stuart’s feet. “Stearns and I
were against the resignation business from the
start,” he said, “but we had the three faculty members
against us right along. We didn’t make much
of a fight against that first resolution, for we thought
it might be a good thing if you came and talked it
over with the Committee. Where you made your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
mistake was not doing it, Stuart. When you sent
your resignation in Stearns and I did everything we
could to get the Committee to lay it on the table and
appoint a sub-committee to see you, but Pierson and
Wallace and Dodge wouldn’t stand for it. We
called Coach Haynes in that evening and he was
flatly against accepting the resignation, but——”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” exclaimed Stuart.</p>

<p>“Yes, Haynes told us plainly that we shouldn’t
accept your resignation until we’d made another
effort to smooth things over with you. But the
faculties were on their dignity, and Pierson said
you’d had your chance and had refused it. When
it came to a vote Stearns and I were two against
three and we lost out.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that,” muttered Stuart.</p>

<p>“You know it now, son,” answered Jud McColl
dryly. “It’s a pretty good idea not to go off half-cocked,
Stuart.” Then McColl laughed and slapped
Stuart on the shoulder. “Buck up and smile!”</p>

<p>Stuart managed the smile, but it wasn’t very
hearty. “Sorry I made such an ass of myself, Jud,”
he mumbled. “Thanks for—for what you did.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome, son. Sorry we couldn’t do
more. If I’d had any idea you were going to come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
back with that resignation like that I’d have been
around to see you. It wouldn’t have done any harm,
you know, if you’d met us halfway instead of flying
off the handle like that. What was the big idea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know.” Stuart shook his head dejectedly.
“I thought it was Haynes’s doing and I
was sore.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, Haynes did put the matter before
the Committee, but he only asked to have things
cleared up so the team would get along better. I
don’t believe for a moment that he wanted you out,
old man. Look here, why don’t you call it an even
break and start over again? Why not go out and
help them along, Stuart?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they don’t need me,” muttered the
other. “Besides, I’d be off my game.”</p>

<p>“Well, think it over and see if you can’t forget
your hurt feelings. So long!”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was unfortunate that, fifty yards further
on, passing Sawyer, Stuart almost collided with
Steve Le Gette, and that to Stuart it seemed that Le
Gette’s startled look changed, as he sheered aside,
into an expression of malicious triumph. In any
event, the chance meeting drove out of Stuart’s mind
any effect caused by McColl’s advice. He certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
wouldn’t go back to the team as long as Le Gette
was there to sneer, he told himself!</p>

<p>Until three or half-past in the afternoons Stuart
got along fairly well, for there was plenty to occupy
his mind, but when the hour of football practice arrived
he felt horribly lost. When you’ve been doing
a certain thing at a certain time each day for a long
period you can’t help missing that thing when it’s
no longer there for you to do. Stuart tried studying,
but the silence of the well-nigh empty hall oppressed
him. Besides, the hours between three and
six of a fine October day were never meant to be
wasted in poring over the pages of a text book!
Even Neil realized that and, though he would offer
to remain in Number 12 and keep Stuart company,
the latter always refused to allow him to do so.
Neil’s favorite retreat in good weather was a bench
beside the tennis courts, or, when there happened to
be a match in progress, the summit of the short
ladder, from where he gravely made some such announcement
as; “The games are three—one. Mr.
Spudkins leads.” Several times he induced Stuart
to accompany him to the courts, but the football
player didn’t entertain Neil’s enthusiasm for tennis
and after looking on through half a dozen games he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
got bored and restless. He had really tried very
hard to find interest in golf, but as he had never
played enough to more than learn the modus operandi
he failed. He might have found a place in one
of the four-oared shells without much trying, for he
was a fair hand with a sweep and there were always
from three to ten dormitory and class crews in training
during the fall, but the plain truth is that he
wanted to play football and didn’t want to do anything
else. Even to have gone to the field and
looked on would have been better than nothing, but
pride forbade that. He was surely at a loose end
those days, and the fact that every afternoon for a
week provided ideal football weather made it seem
that even Nature was taking a hand in his chastening.
But on the day of his enlightening talk with
Judson McColl chance offered him a solution of one
difficulty.</p>

<p>He stopped at the bulletin board in the corridor of
Manning and, for want of a better way in which to
pass a couple of minutes, read some of the notices.
The fact that Sawyer, 22 Meigs, had lost a gray
sweater, or that Lumkin, 8 Byers, wanted to buy a
second-hand typewriter didn’t engross him.
Neither did a plaintive call for candidates for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
soccer football team. He was in a mood to bear
with splendid equanimity the failure of Sawyer to
recover his sweater, the inability of Lumkin to acquire
a typewriter and the utter collapse of the soccer
team. But a moment later he came across an announcement
that did excite his interest. It was already
a week or more old and it announced the date
of the Fall Handicap Meeting and stated that entries
would be received up to and including November 4.
The notice was signed “Charles E. Dodge, 2 Sawyer
Hall.” Mr. Dodge was the Physical Director, and,
with The Laird, attended to the training of the track
and field candidates.</p>

<p>Stuart reread the announcement and then frowned
thoughtfully. In his junior year he had won third
place in the Spring Track Meet in the mile and had
just failed of capturing fourth in the half. Last
year he had won his place on the eleven and lost interest
in the cinder path. But somewhere there
was a pair of spiked canvas shoes with his name
lettered on the lining in faded ink, and there was
time enough for all the practice he wanted. He
didn’t believe for a moment that he could finish the
mile or get placed in the half mile, but it wouldn’t be
bad fun trying, and, which was really his reason for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
considering the idea, the running track surrounded
the second team gridiron, and from the second team
gridiron one could see very nicely what was going on
in first team circles! In other words, while he
wouldn’t have gone to the first team field and
watched practice for anything, he could see no
reason why it shouldn’t be perfectly permissible to
take up track work and sometimes, in the pauses of
practicing starts or after a jog around the cinders,
cast an occasional uninterested glance over toward
the big team. The more he considered the plan the
better it looked to him, and so, without more ado, he
walked over to Sawyer Hall, discovered Mr. Dodge
in his study and put his name down for the mile run
and the 880 yards. Mr. Dodge was in a chatty
mood and Stuart had to stay and talk much longer
than he wanted to. The Physical Director did not,
however, refer to Stuart’s resignation from the football
captaincy, and so Stuart forgave him for his
loquaciousness and tried hard to become interested
in track matters and the chances of capturing the
Dual Meet with Pearsall next May. Mr. Dodge observed,
evidently quite sincerely, that he hoped the
team would have Stuart’s services when that time
arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>When he told Neil that evening the latter was
clearly puzzled. “Why,” he said doubtfully, “I
dare say you’ll get some fun out of it, Stuart, but
you’ll find yourself in pretty punk condition, I’m
afraid. And there’s only a few days left for practice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t expect to do anything,” answered the
other. “I’ll probably last about two laps in the mile
and finish last in the other, but I’m not doing anything
just now, and a fellow ought to keep in some
sort of condition. I may go in for basket ball after
recess. Or maybe hockey. I wonder where those
running shoes of mine got to.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon he was out on the track. The
Laird, who found time from duties with the football
team to give a few minutes daily to the track
men, viewed his appearance with surprised approval
and warned him against overwork. Stuart dryly
assured him that he had no reason for uneasiness,
and The Laird puckered his brows and nodded.
Evidently the new candidate for track honors wasn’t
to be considered very seriously. Mr. Dodge, however,
appeared to entertain no doubts on the subject
of Stuart’s earnestness and, when he arrived to look
after the candidates, displayed an embarrassing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
even annoying interest in the newcomer. If only to
keep from disappointing Mr. Dodge, Stuart was
forced for several succeeding afternoons to make a
plausible pretense of training, something that rather
interfered with his observation of the first team
practice. Of course, he found himself hideously
out of form and suspected that some of the other
candidates were viewing his presence on the track
with a mixture of sympathy and amusement. But
he didn’t mind that so very much. What he would
have minded was the knowledge that Coach Haynes
and the football fellows were suspecting the real
reason for his proximity to the first team gridiron.
But it is scarcely likely that any of them, unless,
possibly, it was Jack, gave any thought to the matter.</p>

<p>After the third day on the cinders Stuart found
that a little of his former speed and stamina had returned
to him, although he still doubted his ability
to give any of his competitors a real race in either of
the events for which he was entered, even if he had
been inclined to. Judging, however, by the time he
spent on the track and beside it, you would have
thought him a most determined candidate, for he was
always one of the first to arrive and he never left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
until after the football men had gone from the gridiron.
If he spent most of his time sitting around in
his bathrobe and looking across the field, that was his
own affair. Hadn’t The Laird warned him against
overwork?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>THE HANDICAPS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Fall Handicap Meet took place on a
Thursday afternoon, and practically the
whole school turned out in the rôle of contestant,
official or onlooker. Of course there were
some not present; the baseball players, who were
drawing to the end of fall practice; a few tennis enthusiasts;
a few others who preferred the river to
the grand stand; and the football men. But of the
latter not all remained away, for a handful had been
given leave to take part in the events. Le Gette and
Leonard were there to toy with the shot and hammer,
Earnest Lowe was on hand to compete in both
the pole vault and the sprints, and there were as
many others who had changed canvas for “shorts.”
Over fifty lads had entered, the Junior Class being
rather better represented than any of the others.
Some thirty more fellows were on hand in various
official capacities, and among these was Neil Orr
who, as usual on such occasions, was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
timers. Naturally, there weren’t very many left to
act as audience.</p>

<p>The afternoon was clear and there was warmth in
the sunlight, but a cool breeze blew down the stretch
and kept the gaudily colored bathrobes of the entrants
wrapped tightly about lightly-clothed bodies.
When Stuart reached the track a little after three the
field events were already under way, and lithe, white-clad
figures were busy at the vaulting and jumping
standards. He could see, too, the big form of
Steve Le Gette poised momentarily like a statue ere
he sent the shot away. Stuart’s first event was the
half mile, and that was set for three-forty, and so,
clutching his robe closely about his bare legs, he
seated himself on the turf beside Tom Hanson.
Tom, excused from football work for the afternoon,
was entered for the 100 and 220 events. Half a
dozen other contestants were in the group, watching
the trials of the 100-yards hurdles which had just
started.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know you were in this game,” observed
Hanson as Stuart joined the group. “What’s
yours, Cap? Quarter mile?”</p>

<p>Tom had used the title from force of habit and
probably didn’t know that he had used it, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Stuart realized after he had shot a quick glance at
the other’s smiling face. Stuart explained that he
was down for the half mile and the mile.</p>

<p>“Haven’t done much running lately, have you?”
Tom asked.</p>

<p>“Not much. Won’t to-day, probably. Thought
I’d just like to keep my hand in, you know.”</p>

<p>“Meaning your legs,” chuckled Tom. “Well,
you’ll have plenty of company in your events, I
guess; especially the mile. About every junior who
has two good legs thinks he’s a miler. I know, for I
did myself when I came. Ran fourteenth in a field
of thirteen, or something like that, and then The
Laird got me to try the sprints. Mighty glad he
did, too, for it was only the fact that I could manage
the hundred in ten flat that got me on the football
team. That was last year. Remember?”</p>

<p>Stuart nodded. “Certainly do, Tom. That was
some run of yours in the Forest Hill game. Eighty-five
yards, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Eighty, to be truthful. Or half a yard more,
maybe. It was a funny piece of luck. I’d been
sitting on the bench ever since the season started and
hadn’t been in a game. Fair enough, too, for all I
could do was punt a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“How about run?” laughed Stuart.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I could sprint, but I mean I wasn’t
much use as far as football stuff went. That day
they laid Pitkin out cold in the first quarter, if you
remember, and then Ernie got a kick in the head and
for some reason or other Coach picked on me.
That was in the third quarter, close to the end of it,
and the ball was about seven yards from our goal.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and third down, too, with only two to go,”
added Stuart grimly. “Forest Hill had us beaten,
9 to 0. Anyway, we all thought so.”</p>

<p>“So did the coach,” chuckled Tom Hanson.
“Anyway, he just told me that here was a good
chance to improve my education, and to go on in at
right half. ‘Any orders, sir?’ I asked, mighty
knowing. He looked disgusted and said: ‘No,
except you can tell those Little Lord Fauntleroys
out there to bring the ball back when they get
through playing with it!’ He was sore, all right.”</p>

<p>“We all were,” said Stuart reflectively. “Forest
Hill had been making goats of us for three periods
and we didn’t seem able to help ourselves. Gee, we
didn’t know enough football to play a night school!”</p>

<p>“Well, that was certainly a lucky fumble,” mused
Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“Lucky for us,” grunted Stuart. “Those fellows
were so certain of that touchdown they thought they
didn’t have to really play. I saw the ball jump out
of the back’s hands and I tried mighty hard to get
through to it, but Stoughton was in my way. I
yelled ‘<em>Ball! Ball!</em>’ until I was hoarse, and no one
seemed to hear me. Our line was just pushing and
shoving, like a lot of fellows paid by the day! They
didn’t seem to realize that nothing was hitting
them and that the whole Forest Hill team was chasing
the ball! Guess you were the only other
chap of our crowd who saw the blamed thing was
loose!”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d never get around to it,” said Tom.
“It rolled out to the left of our line and I had to upset
Lever to get him out of my way. When I got
to it luck played right into my hands. It was still
bobbing around, with about six of the enemy grabbing
for it. Just as I edged in it must have hit a
pebble, I guess, for blamed if it didn’t hop about
eighteen inches into the air and right into my paws.
After that it was easy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, awfully easy,” said Stuart derisively. “All
you had to do was get clear of the whole Forest Hill
mob and run eighty yards!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“Well, no one troubled me much,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“N-no, not after you’d got going good, but I had
seven varieties of heart failure for a while. Boy,
you surely traveled!”</p>

<p>“Had to! Besides, I was fresh as a daisy. Just
as soon as I’d worked out of the crowd I knew I
was all right. There wasn’t one of that bunch
who wasn’t too tired to give me a race.”</p>

<p>“That got us the game,” reflected Stuart. “Gee,
but I’ll never forget how crazy we were when we
saw you go over that line! After that we just got
it into our heads that Forest Hill wasn’t such a sight
better than we were, and we tore her up.”</p>

<p>“It looked like we’d started too late, though,
until you got off that forward pass to ‘Mudgard.’
Even then I wouldn’t have bet much on our winning.”</p>

<p>“No, for Burns had a mean angle to kick from
and there was some wind. Not much, but plenty to
queer his aim. At that, if you remember, the old
pigskin hit the bar going over!”</p>

<p>“Sure do,” chuckled Hanson. “I remember lots
of things about that game.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you do. I guess you remember the way
the fellows got up and cheered you when you came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
in to supper that night, for one thing!” Stuart
laughed softly. “You certainly were the popular
guy that time, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! Anyway, that got me started.
That’s why I say I’m glad I didn’t make a miler.
If I’d finished that race much better than twelfth or
thirteenth—anyway, last but one—I’d have gone
right on running the distances.”</p>

<p>Stuart nodded. “And we’d have lost a crackajack
half, Tom. Glad you were so rotten. Bet
you, though, I’ll do even worse to-day than you
did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you’ll finish pretty well up,” said
Tom. “Of course that poor fish, Lantwood, will
win. Say, I can’t stand that chap.”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t horribly attractive to me,” responded
the other, “but I’ve nothing against him.
He certainly can run the mile; and the half, too, for
that matter. What have you got against the lad,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve heard two or three things,” answered
Tom vaguely.</p>

<p>“Such as what?”</p>

<p>But Tom shook his head. “I’d rather not tell,
Cap. They might not be true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“Then why do you put stock in them?” laughed
Stuart.</p>

<p>Tom grinned. “Well, I’m satisfied that they
are true, but—oh, well, they mightn’t be! Say,
how did he manage to make Lyceum, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I forget who backed him. He came in with a
crowd last January.” Stuart’s brow darkened.
“It is funny that a chap like Austin Lantwood can
make the society and a decent fellow like Neil Orr
gets blackballed! It makes me sick.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Tom agreed. “It was rather putrid,
I thought. Ever learn who did it, Cap?”</p>

<p>“I know who did it, all right,” replied Stuart
morosely. “And he’ll get his some day.”</p>

<p>“Well!” Tom viewed his companion speculatively.
“Guess it wasn’t the fellow I thought it
might be, then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who you thought it was,” said
Stuart, “but there’s just one fellow it could be.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>But Stuart’s reply was prevented by the stentorian
summons to the half-milers and he left Tom
and went over to the starting line. Jud McColl was
in charge there, and when Stuart had answered to
his name he was sent down to his mark. Only Austin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
Lantwood stood on scratch. He was a tall,
thin, pale-faced, upper-middler with colorless hair
and light blue eyes. But he had the runner’s build
and the muscles of his stem-like legs worked like
oiled machinery under the skin. Tully, a senior,
came next. Then half a dozen more were sprinkled
along the cinders to where Stuart was stationed
with three others, evidently all juniors, somewhat
nervous and jumpy. Still others were placed here
and there around the turn. Secretly, Stuart considered
that the handicappers had been more flattering
than charitable in awarding him his allowance.
Still, he was so little concerned in his fortunes that
he couldn’t muster up even a mild indignation.
After the usual delay, a pistol went off behind him
and he sprang forward. It took six strides to secure
the position next to the rim, and he had to
yield place to one of the juniors to reach it. After
that he settled into a fair pace and determined to
hold it, no matter what happened, until he had
reached the end of the backstretch on the second,
and last, lap.</p>

<p>There had been nineteen starters and when Stuart
was well into the backstretch on that first lap more
than half of the number were ahead of him. Lantwood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
didn’t pull up and past until the last turn was
behind. Tully was close at his heels, with Farnsworth,
one of Stuart’s classmates, coming stride for
stride with him. The bell rang for the final
lap with the field well bunched in front of the
stand. But after that the runners began to string
out. Just past the first turn Lantwood sprinted and
took the lead and Tully fell into third place, with
Farnsworth still keeping pace with him. Stuart
was then eighth man, and until he was well into the
backstretch he had some notion of bettering his
place. But the next moment he realized that he
would be lucky to finish, for Lantwood was setting a
fast pace and Stuart’s breath was going fast. Halfway
along the back he fell into tenth position, and
from there on he ran in genuine distress. He got
back his wind a little at the last corner, but he was
still in bad shape and finished just about dead-beat in
tenth place. Lantwood won in good time by something
over twelve yards, with Tully second, a junior
Levering third and Farnsworth a poor fourth. For
a few minutes Stuart was too busy getting his lungs
working as they should to display much interest in
the result. He was convinced that running was not
his game; at least that running the half mile wasn’t;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and was seriously considering having his name
scratched for the mile.</p>

<p>But there remained half an hour before that event
was to be run, and maybe he’d better wait and see
how he felt. After all, it was sort of yellow to give
up so early. He could at least start. Hanson,
who had won into the finals in both sprints, told him
he had run a good race.</p>

<p>“I was watching you, Cap,” said Tom, “and you
surely handled yourself well. Of course your
trouble is that you haven’t had enough work. I
wouldn’t wonder, though, if you’d do a heap better
in the mile. Guess the longer distance and the
slower pace is your meat. Let some one pace you
for the first three laps, Cap. Then you don’t have
to trouble about your time so much. Get in behind
Tully, if you can. He’s a mighty steady runner
and you can depend on him to take you to the fourth
lap in good shape. Old Tully’s a fox at the running
game. Maybe he isn’t as fast as Lantwood, but he
always finishes with something left, and a couple of
years from now he will be getting a lot more firsts
than that poor simp.”</p>

<p>“I might almost think, to listen to your talk, Tom,
that you didn’t like Lantwood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, he can run,” answered Tom, “and so can a
coyote.”</p>

<p>“Ever see one?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll bet he’d look a lot like Lantwood!”</p>

<p>“I won’t bet with you. Guess I’ll go over and
see what sort of a handicap they’re giving me for
the mile.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” demanded Tom incredulously.
Stuart shook his head. “Well, you surely are
taking a big interest in this business! Are you quite
sure you’ve got your name down?”</p>

<p>Stuart grinned. “Why anticipate trouble, old
son?” he asked. “It’s bound to turn out that they
haven’t given me more than half the handicap I
ought to have.”</p>

<p>“Now,” answered the other approvingly, “you
sound like a real ath-a-lete!”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Hope you cop your sprints, Tom.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll get first in the two-twenty, with any
sort of luck, but I’m not likely to do better than third
in the other. Lowe has that cinched, and Bannister’s
a bit better than me at the distance. I’m a
rotten starter. Ernie always has two yards on me
at the gun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Well, there’s your call. Let’s see you beat the
bunch, Tom.”</p>

<p>Tom’s prediction regarding the 220-yard dash
proved correct, for he finished well ahead of the
other three men, but, later in the afternoon, he was
proved to be slightly wrong as to the short sprint.
Instead of finishing third behind Ernest Lowe and
Bannister, he finished second, with Bannister ahead
and Lowe behind. For once, as he confided to
Stuart afterwards, he had beaten Ernie away from
the mark, and his satisfaction over that achievement
far exceeded his pleasure in winning the two-twenty!
But Tom Hanson was not the only contestant of the
afternoon who succeeded in accomplishing the unexpected.</p>

<small>THE LAST LAP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap"><em>“All out for the mile run! Milers this way!”</em></p>

<p>Stuart was glad when the summons came,
for the hour was growing late, the shadows
were stretching far across the field and the
air was getting decidedly chill. Even the woolen
bathrobe no longer sufficed to keep the cold from his
legs, and only by frequent exercising and rubbings
was he able to hold the muscles from tightening.
Many of the patient spectators were wandering
shiveringly down from the stand to loiter up and
down the side of the track. The field events were
over, all save the pole vault. In that Ernest Lowe
was still fighting for first place with Kendall, a lower
middler and a horse of the darkest hue. Already
the school record had been broken and there was
every indication that the Dual record would share
the same fate.</p>

<p>Neil swung himself over to where Stuart pranced
about down beyond the first turn. “Go get ’em,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
he called cheerfully as he approached across the turf.
Stuart shook a gloomy head.</p>

<p>“A swell chance,” he protested. “Look at the
handicap! A hundred and forty yards in a mile run!
A lot of good that will be to me! And there’s
Smiley over there with more than two hundred.”</p>

<p>“You’re better than he is, though, aren’t you?”
asked Neil.</p>

<p>“Maybe a little,” allowed the other disconsolately.
“But I’m too cold to run now. My muscles are all
twisted up. It’s a crazy piece of business to keep
us hanging around like this!”</p>

<p>“I guess the others are just as cold,” said Neil
cheerfully. “There’s quite a bunch of you, isn’t
there? Must be nearly twenty.”</p>

<p>“For two cents I’d quit,” muttered Stuart, looking
back up the track that was sprinkled with
runners.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t,” advised Neil. “You may do a lot
better than you expect and be mighty glad you ran.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do the half, anyway,” replied the other
grudgingly as the warning cry of “<em>On your mark!</em>”
floated down to him.</p>

<p>“Well, good luck,” said Neil. “Don’t start off too
fast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>Stuart nodded, his face set forward now, his
hands tightening on the cork grips. After a long
moment of suspense the pistol rang out and Stuart
jogged into his stride.</p>

<p>A mile race is seldom of much interest to the spectators
during the first two laps. The positions of
the contestants change so gradually that there is no
thrill to be had. Infrequently a runner sets out to
run down an opponent, but the spurt is soon over.
Stuart overhauled a junior on the first lap and was
himself passed by Candee, a rather stocky senior who
used so short a stride that the wonder was he could
keep it up for the three laps that was generally his
limit. At the starting line shouts of encouragement
awaited the runners as they sped past, and Stuart
heard his own name from several lips. It was Tom
Hanson’s voice, however, that sounded loudest.</p>

<p>“Nice running, Cap!” shouted Tom. “Lengthen
out a bit!”</p>

<p>Stuart realized the wisdom of that advice, for he
had unconsciously been clipping his stride and running
high. He was fairly in the ruck as he approached
the corner. Farnsworth was edging past
him and half a dozen others were strung along in
front and behind. Not content with the pace directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
in front of Stuart, Farnsworth ran wide at
the beginning of the turn and then edged in ahead
of a long-legged junior who had not been able to
hold his generous handicap. Stuart considered passing
the junior, too, taking pace from Farnsworth,
but the result seemed not worth the effort and he
hugged the inside rim and pegged on. His body was
warm enough now and his muscles, in spite of his
earlier fear, were supple and responsive. Also, he
had found his wind nicely. He was, in fact, thoroughly
enjoying the battle, and the idea of quitting
at the end of the second lap was forgotten. Farnsworth
was a dozen yards away when Stuart straightened
out on the backstretch, and the long-legged
junior was slowing up. Stuart went outside the
latter and slipped back into place beside the four-inch
boards. The breeze had passed and the evening
air was still and frostily cold. As he came to
the next turn he saw, across the turf, the face of the
old stand, dyed orange-red in the rays of the sinking
sun. All around the quarter-mile path now the contestants
were strung, a few palpably out of the race
and only persevering from motives of pride. He
couldn’t see either Lantwood or Tully without turning
his head, but he felt that the former at least was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
fairly close behind. He wished that Tully would
pass him, for he had not forgotten Tom Hanson’s
advice to tie to the more experienced miler and hold
him to the end of the third lap at least. But Tully
didn’t show up. Stuart promised himself to be
ready to go after him when he did.</p>

<p>It was Lantwood who passed first. He chose the
straightaway for the maneuver, spurting where the
watchers were clustered thickest about the track.
Stuart reflected that that was like Lantwood, for
the pasty-faced youth always played to the gallery
when he could. He didn’t let Lantwood’s sprint
hurry him, however, and went past the mark in a
babel of sound acclaiming the delight of the spectators
at finding, at last, something to cheer about.
If any one hailed his passing he didn’t know it, for
Lantwood’s spectacular burst of speed brought forth
an acclaim that drowned all other applause.</p>

<p>The first corner found his feet growing heavy
and his breathing beginning to shorten, but he had
the comforting assurance that the others were in a
like case, some more so, some less. He could not,
however, help glancing enviously at the fleet-footed
Lantwood. The latter was some forty yards ahead,
leading the field, his head up and his thin legs working<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
like two pieces of machinery. That, acknowledged
Stuart, was real running, and he was momentarily
impatient with himself for having the temerity
to pit his own amateur efforts against such ability.
But the <em>pat-scrunch</em> of shoes beside him put the
thought out of his mind and he turned his head a
fraction to see who was passing him.</p>

<p>It was Tully, big and raw-boned and earnest.
There was something impressive about Tully’s running,
even if he never finished better than second
or, more often, third. Tully set his pace a dozen
strides from the start and never changed it. He
knew how fast he could run four laps of the track,
and he made his plans accordingly. If the pace he
set wasn’t hard enough to wear the other man out,
why, that was something else. Some day, Tully
promised himself, his pace would do the trick. It
was only a matter of finding the pace that, persisted
in from the start to finish, would carry him to victory.
Meanwhile, those who depended on a final,
heart-bursting sprint to carry them the last part of
the way won from him only tolerant contempt.
Whether he finished first or second or tenth, Tully
would always step off the track with a tranquil
countenance and walk unhesitatingly to the dressing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
room. Stamina was old Tully’s long suit, and,
as The Laird observed frequently, if the Dual Meet
provided for a two-mile run Tully would win such
an event at a jog!</p>

<p>Tully never glanced aside as he went slowly,
methodically past Stuart, and gradually took the
pole again. Behind Tully ran Walton, and Stuart
had no intention of letting the latter by just then.
Stuart increased his speed for a half-dozen strides
and placed himself behind Tully. From there he
went on like the bigger fellow’s shadow, matching
stride for stride. Of the twenty or so who had
started only a dozen were left in the running, although
all but three were still jogging about the
track, hopelessly distanced. Ahead of Stuart were
five men: Lantwood, with nearly a quarter of a lap
lead; a red-headed fellow whose name Stuart did
not know; Smiley who, although he had lost much
of his handicap, was still running nicely; Farnsworth,
who was falling back at the turn, and Tully.
Farnsworth appeared to have shot his bolt too soon,
for he was evidently in distress already. Stuart’s
own condition was not, he reflected, anything to
boast of, but he could still pound out the strides
and still keep his head level. Toe to heel with Tully,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
he took the corner and drew up on Farnsworth.
The latter was wobbling badly. Across the next
corner, Stuart observed that the unknown redhead
was slowing up.</p>

<p>The gong had clanged the beginning of the last
lap, announcing that Lantwood had crossed the
mark. At that moment Tully edged outward and
Stuart took his cue from the big fellow and they
went past Farnsworth. Then the straightaway began,
with the crowd about the finish line. The gong
clanged again. That would be either the redhead
or Smiley, thought Stuart. He couldn’t see which
was ahead. A moment later he was himself passing
the crowd, and cheers for Tully and for Harven
were sounding loudly. Stuart thought he heard
Tom Hanson’s voice, but he wasn’t sure. It didn’t
matter, anyhow. Nothing much did matter but the
fact that Tully was setting a hard pace to follow.
Of course Tully hadn’t altered his speed a mite. It
wasn’t that. It was merely that Stuart was getting
to the limit of his endurance, or thought he was,
which was much the same thing.</p>

<p>The turn brought a certain relief and encouragement.
Another corner would bring the backstretch,
and after that the last turn and then the homestretch.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Halfway down the further side of the track, Lantwood
was going easily. He was not running so fast
now, but he didn’t have to. He had the race as certainly
as if he was already stepping across the line.
There was no longer any question of who would
win, if there ever had been. All that remained to
be settled was the matter of second, third and fourth
places. Well, if he could hold out, Stuart reflected,
he would be sure of fourth position. Tully would
get second, of course, and Smiley third. The redhead
was beaten, plodding away with head swaying
and his stride short. They’d pass him at the next
turn. Funny, thought Stuart, if he and old Tully
were to fight it out for fourth place, for Smiley still
had a comfortable lead and still seemed able. He
wondered what handicap Tully had had. Not much,
probably, for the old warrior was a real runner at
the mile. A swift glance over his shoulder showed
Stuart that the nearest pursuer was at least thirty-odd
yards behind and in poor shape. No danger
from that quarter.</p>

<p>The red-haired youth dropped by them as they
turned into the backstretch. Ahead, Smiley was
having trouble. Stuart could see the uncertainty of
his stride. Once Smiley’s head came back, was recovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
and fell sidewise for an instant. Perhaps,
then, it was to be third place he was to fight for, and
the thought gave him a thrill. But, halfway along
the stretch, his own legs began to go back on him.
They didn’t feel as if they belonged to him any more.
His head, too, got silly. It wouldn’t stay where it
belonged. Something was wrong with his neck, for
the muscles pained him and felt knotted. But of
course one didn’t stop so long as he could still get
his breath and keep his feet moving. If the rim of
the track would keep out of his way and not try
to trip him up he could do better. If he ever caught
a spike in the wood—</p>

<p>Tully’s body leaned to the left. Stuart got a
better grip on himself and followed around the corner.
There was a lot of noise from across the field.
Perhaps Lantwood had finished. No, Lantwood
was still in sight, just vanishing into the lane formed
by the crowd. Ahead, but considerably nearer, was
Smiley. Stuart guessed they’d beat Smiley. He
wondered if Tully hadn’t slackened his speed a mite.
Here they were at the last corner already, and if
Tully would only hit it up a bit they might get by
Smiley before the finish came. But Tully kept on
untroubledly. Stuart, sobbing for breath now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
wobbling a bit more on the legs that didn’t seem his,
was impatient. Didn’t the silly idiot <em>want</em> to win
second place? What was the matter with him?
Why, Smiley was all in; any one could see it; and
all they had to do was speed up just a little to pass
him!</p>

<p>A dozen strides further on Stuart became angry.
He wanted to call out to Tully and tell him to sprint,
but he knew there was no breath left him for any
such purpose. Then, without reasoning a moment,
he eased his pace a fraction, turned slightly and ran
even with the big fellow. He wanted to say “Come
on!” but he couldn’t even close his mouth to form
the words. For three strides he matched strides
with Tully, and then drew ahead. He had no longer
any conscious thought of winning second place.
Ahead of him, only a little way ahead of him now,
was the faltering Smiley, and Stuart wanted to pass
Smiley. He couldn’t have explained just then why
he wanted to, but he did. It was a sudden obsession.
The sight of Smiley’s swaying form ahead
affronted him. He closed his dizzy eyes and forced
himself on.</p>

<p>The sound of excited cheers, cries, exhortations
might have been the murmur of a breeze among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
leaves so far as Stuart was concerned. Later he remembered
hearing it perfectly, but just then, as he
went swaying toward the finish line, it made no impression.
There was but one thought in his mind.
He must reach that other runner and get past him.
And reach him he did, a scant four strides from the
mark. After that it was just a question of inches
between second man and third, and of feet between
third man and fourth, for Stuart and Smiley and
Tully finished in a bunch. The principal difference
was less in space than in condition, for whereas
both Stuart and Smiley toppled into the arms of
bystanders, old Tully kept on for a dozen paces,
slowed gradually and then walked off to where he
had left his bathrobe.</p>

<p>The judge at the finish said that Stuart had won
by a button, which was near enough the truth. Personally
Stuart didn’t care a bit for as much as five
minutes whether he had won at all. But when he
could sit up again and look about him on a hazy
world the knowledge brought a warming satisfaction.
A dozen fellows were telling him that he had
run a great race, that he had shown fine generalship
and a lot of other complimentary things, to all of
which Stuart listened amiably and in silence. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
he allowed Tom Hanson to raise him to his feet
and some one else to hold his robe for him; and a
pale, panting youth who proved to be Smiley, shook
hands with him and said “Congratulations, Harven,”
and Stuart grinned and answered “Thanks! Ought
to have been you,” and, so far as Stuart was concerned,
the Fall Handicap Meet was at an end.</p>

<p>Of course a certain renown accrued to him, and
the race was talked of for a day or two. The Laird
tried to get him to promise to keep on training for
the track, promising to make a great miler of him
by the next year, but Stuart shook his head. “It
was rather fun,” he acknowledged, “but I’m through,
Laird. I’m not really a track man. Next year—well,
I guess I’ll be playing football again by then.”</p>

<p>A second team player made the statement that “as
a football captain Harven was a great mile runner,”
and the <i lang="fr">bon mot</i> won much favor among those who
were not in sympathy with Stuart’s recent behavior.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<small>NEIL INTERVENES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Although Stuart managed to remain
away from the football field during practice,
the temptation to witness the Saturday contests
from a closer point of observation than the
running track was too strong to be resisted. Anyway,
even if a fellow didn’t any longer concern himself
with the fortunes of his own team, he naturally
wanted to see how the other fellow comported himself.
So when the St. Charles contest was played
he and Neil were occupants of seats at a far end of
the stand. There wasn’t much to excite oneself over
in the course of that game, for the visitor was outplayed
from the start, and out-generaled as well.
Coach Haynes put in a wealth of substitutes in the
third and fourth periods, and even then the final
score was satisfactorily decisive, being 21 to 0 in
favor of the Cherry-and-Gray. But during the succeeding
game, that with the Brown Freshmen, Neil
was really sorry for his chum. Stuart pretended
indifference and tried very, very hard to maintain a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
studied calm, but the way in which he clenched his
hands and wriggled in his seat and made funny
noises in his throat, told Neil that he wasn’t happy.
There was no good reason why he should have been
happy, for that matter. The Brown youngsters
were too many for the Cherry-and-Gray from the
first kick-off, and, although Manning fought hard
and twice held the enemy from scoring in the first
two periods, she couldn’t get her own offense working
decently and never once threatened the enemy’s
goal. Individually, the Manning linemen were
good, but they didn’t seem to get together well. The
backfield had lost its aggression completely and, while
it was easy enough to lay a portion of the blame on
Wheaton, at quarter, by no means all of it was due
to him. Leo Burns, recovered from his injury, was
at left half, Billy Littlefield at right and Howdy
Tasker at fullback. There were flashes of hard,
brilliant playing, but on the whole the Manning
backfield was a disappointment to-day, especially on
attack. During the intermission Stuart was rather
silent and carefully avoided discussing the game.</p>

<p>The Brown Freshmen started in in the third
quarter harder than ever and at the end of five or
six minutes had scored their first touchdown. Better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
playing and a heavier team counted at last.
Coach Haynes made two changes after that, putting
Le Gette at right tackle in place of Thurston and
Hanson at right half in place of Billy Littlefield.
Hanson’s presence bolstered up the backfield perceptibly,
but Stuart couldn’t see any improvement
in the right tackle position. Probably he didn’t want
to. There was one bright spot in the third period
when, toward the end of it, Howdy Tasker got
away on an old-style fake-kick play and circled
Brown’s left end for thirty-odd yards, placing the
pigskin on the enemy’s twenty-eight. But the advance
failed a few yards beyond, for Wheaton
fumbled a pass, and, although Burns recovered it,
a down had been lost. Tasker got a scant two yards
outside left tackle and then Hanson heaved to Muirgart
and the ball grounded. Burns tried a drop-kick
from the thirty-five-yard line, but the ball sailed
far wide of goal.</p>

<p>Brown crashed her way to a second touchdown in
the last period, finding but weak opposition inside
the ten yards and putting the ball across from there
in three tries at the right of the line. Each of her
touchdowns was followed by a goal, and the final
score was 14 to 0.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>Going back to the dormitory, Stuart’s long-pent
emotions burst forth. He called the team a disgrace,
an insult to Manning traditions, a gang of
loafers and many other choice names. And he said
hard things about the generalship displayed and the
sort of coaching that could take out a good man like
Thurston and put in Steve Le Gette. He didn’t
criticize Jack’s playing or Jack’s performance of his
duties as captain, nor did he deal unkindly with
Wheaton, but about every other player was thoroughly
hauled over the coals. As for “Wheat,”
Stuart declared that he had done as well as any fellow
had a right to expect. “He’s no wonder, but
he worked himself to death, pretty near, with a backfield
that was asleep on its feet most of the time!
Why Littlefield just stopped when he got to the line
and looked for a comfortable place to sit down!
Hanson was some better, but he didn’t show
enough punch to break a lath. If that’s the sort
of team Haynes thinks is going to lick Pearsall, he’s
got a jolt coming to him!”</p>

<p>Stuart had a lot more to say, and said it, his remarks
lasting until long after he and Neil had
reached Number 12. Finally, though, wrath and
disgust were succeeded by a settled gloom that continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
most of the evening. Neil tried to persuade
him to go over to the village to the movies after
supper, but he wouldn’t, and Neil went off by himself.
In the yard, though, he met Jack and Greg
Trenholme and Howdy Tasker and, on the way to
the village, listened to much post-mortem talk from
the fullback. Coming back after, it must be acknowledged,
a not very hilarious evening at the little
theater, Greg introduced the subject of Stuart.
“Neil, why doesn’t he take a tumble to himself and
go back to the team and help out? Doesn’t he know
that the school’s getting sore at him? After to-day
it’ll look worse than ever.”</p>

<p>Neil didn’t answer, and it was Jack who attempted
an excuse. “Let the poor fellow alone,” he said.
“He’s feeling pretty sore, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No reason for it that I can see,” said Tasker.
“He threw up his job when he didn’t have to. I
call that deserting in the face of the enemy, by jove!
Now, instead of doing the decent thing and playing
quarter, he sulks. I like Stuart, but he’s a pigheaded
ass!”</p>

<p>“We certainly need him,” said Jack feelingly.
“I’m not saying anything against ‘Wheat,’ for he
wasn’t any rottener than most of us to-day, but he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
can’t play the game that Stuart can at quarter, and
no one pretends that he can or ever will. I talked
to Stuart about going back and got sat on.”</p>

<p>“Have you tried it, Neil?” asked Greg.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No good, eh?”</p>

<p>“Some one,” said Tasker impatiently, “ought to
talk turkey to him. I should think he’d see that it’s
his duty to play. Look here, Neil, you’ve got more
influence with him than any one else, I guess.
Why don’t you have a real talk and show him that—that—Gosh,
I should think after seeing to-day’s
game he’d <em>want</em> to get out and do something! I
know plaguy well I would!”</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do,” agreed Neil readily but
not very hopefully. “I’ll try him again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Atta boy! Tell him the school’s getting sore
with him and—”</p>

<p>Jack interrupted Tasker. “No, don’t tell him
anything of the sort, Neil. That would just put his
back up. Tell him the team needs him. That’s the
only thing that’ll fetch him.”</p>

<p>When Neil got back to the room, Stuart had
turned in and was sound asleep, and Neil nodded approvingly.
“A good sleep will make him feel better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
in the morning, I guess,” he said to himself. “And
I’ll tackle him before he gets a chance to catch a new
grouch!”</p>

<p>It was while they were dressing that Neil said
suddenly: “Stuart, will you tell me the truth if I
ask you something?”</p>

<p>Stuart grinned. “I’ll either tell you the truth or
keep my mouth closed,” he replied. “What’s the
question, little one?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you wanting to be back on the team,
Stuart?”</p>

<p>For a long moment it seemed that Stuart meant to
keep his mouth closed. He gave far more attention
to pulling on a sock than the task appeared to demand.
When, however, he had snugged it over
his foot fastidiously he looked up.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” he said.</p>

<p>Neil swung over to his dresser, selected a soft
collar and thrust a blue tie through the loops.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?” he asked finally.</p>

<p>“Because I’ve got some self-respect, I suppose.
And maybe I’m not wanted, anyway.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so, Stuart. The fellows all want
you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe some of them do.” Stuart pulled his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
trousers on and cinched the belt with a jerk. “I’ll
bet Haynes doesn’t, though.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?” asked Neil.</p>

<p>“Why, if he wants me, why doesn’t he—”
Stuart stopped.</p>

<p>“Say so?” supplied the other. “Maybe he thinks
it wouldn’t do any good.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it wouldn’t,” muttered Stuart.</p>

<p>“After all, if the team needs you, and it certainly
does, what Mr. Haynes says or doesn’t say hasn’t
got much to do with it, I guess. It’s the team you’d
be helping and not the coach, Stuart.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be much use there if Haynes didn’t
want me, though. And I guess he’s pretty well satisfied
with things as they are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he can be after yesterday’s
slaughter,” replied Neil. “But I’m glad you’ve explained.”</p>

<p>“Explained what?” asked Stuart suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Why you don’t go back,” answered the other.
“I didn’t want to think that it was just your pride
that was keeping you from doing your duty. If
it’s because Mr. Haynes doesn’t want you, that’s
different. I can understand that, of course. No
one wants to go where he’s not wanted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“You bet he doesn’t,” agreed Stuart.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know that you would go back if it
wasn’t for that,” said Neil. “You would, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” replied the other doubtfully.
Then, seeing Neil’s puzzled look, he added quickly:
“Of course I would!”</p>

<p>Neil’s face cleared and he smiled. “That’s the
ticket! That’s what I wanted to be sure of!”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re mightily interested all of a
sudden,” said Stuart dubiously. “I don’t see that
it makes much difference what the reason is.”</p>

<p>“It makes all the difference in the world,” replied
Neil earnestly. “Anyway, it does to me. You see,
Stuart, I’ve thought all along that you ought to forget
your—your differences with the coach and the
others and just remember that the team needed you.
And I guess I’ve blamed you when I oughtn’t to
have. I thought it was just hurt pride that kept you
away. Now I find that you had a pretty good
reason. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>Stuart thoughtfully stuck his military brushes together
and nodded. “I see,” he answered. “You
ready?” At the door he added: “You’re a queer
idiot, old Neil!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>After breakfast Neil was missing and Stuart went
across to Meigs to put in the time before church
with Jack. Since Jack’s roommate was Stearns
Wilson, Stuart had carefully avoided Number 17
of late, but now, since Jud McColl had eliminated
his only excuse for being down on Wilson, there
was no reason for staying away. Wilson, however,
wasn’t in this morning, as it proved, and Stuart
and Jack had the room to themselves. Something
of the old intimacy between the two was lacking,
it seemed, and the talk, if not exactly constrained,
wasn’t like the talks they used to have.
Stuart assured himself several times that he held no
resentment against Jack, but the fact remained that
somewhere there was a fly in the amber of their
friendship. Stuart didn’t remain in Number 17 until
church time, but left after a half hour or so, feeling
oddly relieved when he had closed the door behind
him, and returned to Lacey. Neil was still absent,
and Stuart, selecting a magazine and throwing
himself on the window seat, wondered where the
dickens he could be.</p>

<p>If by some magic power he could have seen Neil
at that moment he would have been very greatly surprised.</p>

<small>STUART GOES OUT FOR THE TEAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Neil was sitting in an armchair in Coach
Haynes’ front room, his crutches against
his knees. The coach sat near by, close to
one of the long front windows, completely surrounded
by a Sunday paper. Beyond him, through
the casement that reached to the floor, Neil saw the
little park, fenceless, deep in yellow and red maple
leaves, and the abandoned iron fountain in the center,
its basin long dry and filled with the litter of
many seasons. But, against the trees, some of them
still retaining their gaudy foliage, and bathed in the
sunlight of a wonderful early November morning, it
looked rather pretty. Mr. Haynes was smoking an
after-breakfast pipe, and the clouds of gray-blue
smoke writhed and billowed in the shaft of sunlight
that fell athwart the worn carpet and almost restored
the ancient hues of its floral garlands.</p>

<p>“There never has been a moment since Harven
resigned,” the coach was saying, “when I wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
have been mighty glad to have him back in his old
position, Orr, but no good would have come of my
taking any steps to get him. I think you realize
that. I believed that he would come around himself
in time, but I thought it would be before this.
Now that he has decided to return, I’m very glad
of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but he hasn’t,” said Neil, smiling ruefully.
“I mean, he’d like to, but he thinks you don’t
want him.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t any right to think so,” commented
Mr. Haynes. “I suppose he thinks I was instrumental
in ousting him, which I wasn’t, but even so
he should know that the success of the team means
too much to me for me to allow personal likes or
dislikes to interfere. Well, what’s your idea, Orr?
Do you want me to see him and ask him to come
back?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I wouldn’t expect you to do that!” exclaimed
Neil.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do it if it’s necessary,” replied the coach
surprisingly. “But I fancy the less I appear personally
in the matter the more chance we have of
success, Orr. You know Harven, and you know
he’s a chap to be handled with gloves—and mighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
smooth ones at that! For instance, if he learned
you’d been here this morning, and I asked him to
come back to the team, he would naturally connect
the two, jump to the conclusion that you’d worked
on my sympathies and we never would get him.
There’s a better way if we can only think of it.”</p>

<p>The coach puffed hard on his pipe and stared
through the window for a space. Finally: “You
say he doesn’t know you’re here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not from me, sir. And I shan’t tell him.”</p>

<p>The coach nodded and a second silence followed.
At last he turned and rapped the ashes from his
pipe into the ash tray on the arm of his chair. “I’ve
got it, Orr,” he said. “The Laird’s the one to do it.
I’ll see him this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Neil’s face brightened. “That’s so, Mr. Haynes!
They’ve always been great pals! Stuart will listen
to The Laird.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he will. Don’t hurry away, though.
I’m mighty grateful to you for doing this, Orr. I
wish you didn’t have to use those things.” He
pointed smilingly to the crutches. “I’d like you on
the team, old man!”</p>

<p>Neil flushed, not at the allusion to the crutches
but in real pleasure. You see, he sometimes thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
that if he had been like other chaps he could have
done rather well in sports, and it was fine to have
the coach confirm the thought. He made his way
back to school very happy.</p>

<p>Stuart was inclined to be a bit resentful because
Neil had left him alone, but he didn’t insist on knowing
where the other had been and Neil at once began
to bustle around in preparation for church. His
prayer book and hymnal had, it appeared, been misplaced,
and in aiding in the search Stuart forgot his
resentment and any curiosity he may have had.
The missing articles were eventually discovered by
Neil just where he had left them a week before.
It was almost dusk when there came a knock on
the door of Number 12 and The Laird came in.
Stuart had been humped up on the window seat
earnestly wrestling with his English, and Neil was
in the middle of a delayed Sunday letter. The Laird
explained carelessly that he’d been out for a bit of
a walk and thought he’d drop in and pass the time
of day. Stuart was glad to see him and equally glad
of an excuse to close his books, and he made The
Laird comfortable in the biggest of the two easy
chairs and was quite merry. Neil ended his letter
hurriedly during the first minutes of the trainer’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
visit, inclosed it, and, excusing himself, took it down
to the letter box in front of Manning Hall. He
made the trip very leisurely and, on the way back,
stopped in a few minutes with Tom Hanson who
lived on the first floor. He was careful not to make
his absence suspiciously prolonged, however, and
got back to Number 12 some fifteen minutes after
his departure. The trainer was still there and
neither he nor Stuart appeared to have been aware
of Neil’s absence. They were talking football, the
pair of them; discussing the chances of Yale coming
back in time for the Princeton game next Saturday,
and the overthrow of the big colleges in their games
yesterday. It was evident to Neil, however, that
The Laird had performed his mission, and performed
it well since Stuart was unmistakably in an
excited and exalted frame of mind. Presently the
trainer took his leave, and Neil, after waiting a moment
for Stuart to explode the news, asked idly:</p>

<p>“What did The Laird have to say? Anything
new in the world?”</p>

<p>“N-no.” Stuart was elaborately careless. Whatever
he had to tell, Neil saw, wasn’t going to be exploded!
“We were talking about the game Saturday
and one thing and another. Where’d you go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“Out to post my letter. Then I stopped in at Tom
Hanson’s for a minute. It’s getting colder.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Stuart absently fingered the pages of a
book. “I guess we’re in for a cold snap. Glad of
it. You need zippy weather for football. That reminds
me. I’ve decided to go back on the team to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” exclaimed Neil, in surprised and
pleased tones. “I’m awfully glad!”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed ironically. “The Laird says
Haynes was talking to him to-day. What do you
think he asked him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What?”</p>

<p>“Asked him if he thought I meant to come back!
Looks as if he wasn’t so mighty independent, after
all, eh? The Laird says he guesses Haynes would
be tickled to death if I showed up again. And The
Laird sort of wants me to, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” commented Neil. “Only, if he happened
to be wrong about Mr. Haynes you wouldn’t
want to do it, of course.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t wrong,” replied Stuart decisively.
“He’s dead right. I—I’ve sort of suspected—just
lately, I mean—that Haynes wouldn’t be heartbroken
if I reported again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! But you said—”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered the other impatiently. “I
didn’t have anything to go on, you see; it was just
a—just a feeling. Anyway, I’ve decided to risk it.
I’m going out to-morrow afternoon. Gee, it’ll be
good to get back into togs again! Of course, I may
not get my place back, but I don’t care so much.
I’ll have the fun of playing. And—and The Laird
says they need me. There’s only one more game
before Pearsall, but he thinks we’re going to come
back all right. Golly, Neil, we’ve <em>got</em> to! When
you come right down to it, Pearsall hasn’t done so
remarkably well herself this fall. Yesterday’s win
wasn’t anything to brag about. Eleven to
three against Lyons was pretty punk, I’ll say.
They’ll have to do a great sight better playing two
weeks from now if they expect to beat this outfit!”</p>

<p>Stuart, once well started on the subject of football,
gave no signs of tiring. In fact, he kept it up until
supper and, after supper, until bedtime. Neil listened
patiently if not always interestedly, too pleased
with the result of the conspiracy to begrudge attention,
even though it left him ill-prepared for to-morrow’s
recitations. Stuart was too absorbed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
notice that his roommate sometimes hid a yawn behind
a polite hand.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Manager Locker, early on the
field and uninterestedly watching two second-string
backs kicking a ball about, beheld with surprise the
approach of a youth in togs who had, at the distance
of a hundred yards, a remarkable resemblance to
Stuart Harven. Nor did his surprise decrease as
the youth drew nearer and the resemblance increased.
Locker drew in a long breath and ejaculated:
“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” Then he stepped eagerly
forward. “Stuart!” he exclaimed. “Gee, this is
great! Say—”</p>

<p>But Stuart interrupted gravely. “Hello, Fred,”
he said. “I’d like to report for practice.”</p>

<p>Locker opened his mouth for a good laugh, but
something in the other’s face caused him to change
his mind. Instead: “Oh!” he faltered. “That’s
fine! Well, I guess we need——”</p>

<p>“Might take my name if you don’t mind.” Stuart’s
gaze traveled to the breast of Locker’s jacket
and came to rest significantly over an inside
pocket.</p>

<p>“What? Oh, sure!” The manager hurriedly
produced his red book and plucked a pen from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
pocket of his vest. There was no harm in humoring
the other!</p>

<p>“Stuart Harven, seventeen, Upper Middle Class,
12 Lacey,” announced the applicant soberly. Locker
wrote it down.</p>

<p>“Experience?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Two years. Maybe you’d better say three. I
played part of this season.”</p>

<p>Locker nodded, as grave now as Stuart. “What
position?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Quarterback.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Locker closed his book and slipped
it back into his pocket. “I suppose you know about
your physical examination? But I forget; you’ve
played this season already, you said. Report to
the trainer after practice, please. Now, you big
chump, come off your high horse and talk sense!
Are you really going to play?”</p>

<p>Stuart nodded. “If they’ll let me, Fred.”</p>

<p>“<em>Let</em> you? <em>Let</em>—Say, where do you get that
stuff? You watch ’em! I guess the only chap who
won’t be tickled pink is Wheaton. And, at that, I
fancy he won’t be awfully cut up, for Wheat’s bitten
off more than he can Fletcherize, and he knows
it! Here they come now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The squad was beginning to dribble across the
field from the gymnasium. Once past the tennis
courts, the balls began to soar. Stuart saw Coach
Haynes well back in the second group, talking to
Jack. Stuart kept his place beside Fred Locker,
waiting, a trifle woodenly, for his presence to be discovered.
It was Tom Muirgart who first recognized
him and spread the news with a shout. Then
Tom, followed by Billy Littlefield and Wallace
Towne, hiked across the corner of the gridiron and
assaulted him joyfully. It was hard to keep up that
expression and manner of unconcern when Tom was
banging him between the shoulders and Billy was
ruffling his hair with jovial but ungentle hand.
Stuart donned his headgear in protection and
dodged Tom’s enthusiastic palm.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, fellows,” he growled, embarrassed,
and darting an apprehensive look toward the approaching
coach. “Don’t make a—a silly scene!”
But in avoiding Tom’s blows he backed squarely into
the stout arms of Joe Cutts, and Joe seized on him
as though he were an opposing center and lifted him,
struggling and wriggling, off his feet. After that
there was no use in attempting to carry the affair off
with dignity and decorum, and Stuart realized it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
and subsided in weak and futile remonstrances.
“Thirsty” and “Howdy” and “Bee” and half a
dozen others closed about him and pummeled him
joyously or pumped his arms, or, unable to get close
enough to lay violent hands on him, shouted their
welcome. Stuart alternately grinned and scowled;
grinned because grinning seemed to ease the sort of
choky feeling in his throat, and scowled to prove
that he hadn’t grinned!</p>

<p>And then, the group thinning, he found himself
looking straight at the coach. Mr. Haynes smiled
and held out his hand. “Glad to see you, Harven,”
he said cordially.</p>

<p>Foes may clasp hands and still remain foes.
Stuart returned the coach’s firm grip and said:
“Thanks, sir.”</p>

<p>Then practice began.</p>

<p>Stuart discovered that a fortnight or so of idleness
had told on his muscles surprisingly, but he didn’t
allow any one else to suspect it. He went through
formation drill in a squad of substitutes, playing his
old position. He felt that the atmosphere here was
not so sympathetic as it had been among that group
of older players, but he didn’t resent it. Nor did
he resent being left on the bench when, after an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
hour’s practice, the second team trailed across from
the further gridiron and the scrimmage began. He
couldn’t expect to get his place back without a struggle.
That wouldn’t be fair to Wheat, who, no matter
what might be said of his shortcomings, had
tried loyally and hard. For that matter, Stuart reflected,
he might get no better than first substitute’s
place for the rest of the season. To-day he didn’t
care very much. It was so jolly good to get back at
all! He had been an idiot to stay out so long, he
told himself. Haynes had acted pretty decently.
Shown good form, too. Some men would have
been sloppy and hypocritical and some would have
been sneering or sarcastic. Haynes had hit just the
right note, and Stuart was grateful. “You might
dislike Haynes,” he said to himself, “but you have
to respect the guy!”</p>

<p>Stuart’s relegation to the bench during scrimmage
was, perhaps, made more endurable by the presence
near by of Steve Le Gette. It wasn’t that Le
Gette’s mere proximity gave comfort to Stuart, but
it was some satisfaction to know that if Stuart
wasn’t good enough for a place in the line-up,
neither was Le Gette!</p>

<p>Stuart didn’t spend the whole period on the bench,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
however, after all, for toward the end of the
game Wheaton was banished and Stuart slipped
back to his old position for a wonderful five minutes.</p>

<small>WANTED, A KICKER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Stuart’s return to the fold was a matter of
almost as much discussion as his previous retirement
had been. But where he had been
censured before for leaving the squad he was now
censured for returning to it. Among his friends
and closer acquaintances, of course, his action was
approved, but there were some three hundred and
fifty students at Manning that fall and to the bulk
of them Stuart Harven was known by sight only,
and it was from outside his small circle of friends
and admirers that disapproval came. It was largely
held that, having left the team, he should have stayed
off it for the season; that his return would only have
the effect of upsetting football affairs again. Even
among the squad there were some who viewed his
reappearance on the field rather coldly. There was,
however, no doubt as to the sentiment of most of
the players, and Stuart was grateful to those for
their hearty welcome and friendliness. He needed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the encouragement such friendliness gave, for it was
speedily evident that his absence from practice, as
brief as it had been, had played hob with his game.
Much of the old dash was gone, much of his former
initiative lacking. He had to prod himself constantly
in order to show a semblance of his old
form. It was as though the ability to play was inside
him but wouldn’t come out! By the middle of
the week he despaired of “coming back” and realized
disheartenedly that so far as the big game was
concerned he might just as well have stayed away.
But he was of use to the team, and knew it. He
found some comfort in the knowledge, and, which
is to his credit, refused to be downcast and kept
pegging away as hard as he knew how.</p>

<p>Of course what Stuart realized others saw, too.
Wednesday evening Jack brought up the subject
after a conference in Coach Haynes’s quarters. “I
don’t know what’s the matter with Stuart,” he said
troubledly. “He isn’t playing anywhere near his
real game.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the coach. After a moment he added:
“I’m afraid his coming back is going to make more
unhappiness for him, Brewton. I suppose he expected
to get his place again, but it doesn’t look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
now as if he could have it, and I’m afraid he will
think he is injured and blame me.” Mr. Haynes
shook his head regretfully. “It’s too bad. There’s
enough ill feeling on his side toward me already;
and there’s another year to go through with yet.
That is, if I’m back again.”</p>

<p>“But you will be, sir, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Brewton, but a good deal depends on
how things go this year. I was given a one-year
contract with the understanding that if things went
well this fall I should have another for two. If
Pearsall shows us up I fancy I’ll be looking for a
new job.” Mr. Haynes smiled. Then he looked
grave again. “This trouble with Harven has been
mighty unfortunate. The Committee has stood by
me, but I suppose they can’t help thinking that another
man might have got along with less friction.
And I guess they’re right. If I had understood
Harven as well in September as I do now I’d have
handled him differently. I can’t comfort myself
with the assurance that the fault has all been his,
you see. I’ve made mistakes, too, Brewton.”</p>

<p>Jack frowned. “Stuart’s awfully sort of touchy
and stubborn,” he muttered. “I guess it would be
mighty hard for any coach to get along with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
much better than you have. He—hang him!—he’s
got it in for me now. I don’t know why. He’s
as stiff as a ramrod. It can’t be because I took his
place, for I went to him before I accepted it and he
said it was all right, that he’d rather see me captain
than any other fellow. But he acts as if I’d done
something against him!”</p>

<p>Mr. Haynes smiled. “Human nature has some
queer angles, my boy,” he said. “I fancy Harven
really thought he was glad to see you become captain,
and I dare say he’s tried to be, but there’s a
little hurt feeling that persists, and he can’t help
showing it. But I wouldn’t let it bother me. He’ll
get over it in time. By the way, what about
Towne? Have you heard from him since afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but I guess it’s only a cold.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so,” answered the coach grimly.
“We can’t afford to lose our best guard just now.
And we’d certainly be in a hole if he wasn’t on hand
to kick field goals. That’s a weak department with
us, Brewton. Outside of Towne and Harven we
haven’t a fellow we can depend on for field goals.
Tasker is a whale of a punter, but if the Pearsall
game depended on a three-point tally I’d hate to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
have to leave it to him! Of course, if Harven was
in we’d be safe, but unless he bucks up a whole lot
inside of the next week he’s likely to see that game
from the bench. If I were you I’d look in on Towne
to-night and see how he’s making it.”</p>

<p>Jack agreed and took his departure.</p>

<p>Thursday morning it became known that Wally
Towne was ill with something that looked a whole
lot like tonsillitis, and consternation reigned throughout
the school. That afternoon Baker played right
guard and the most promising of the second team’s
guards was requisitioned by Mr. Haynes. Baker,
however, was not a success, and the second team
fellow, although he was scrappy and quick and
worked hard, was much too light for the place. On
Friday the coach tried an experiment, and Steve Le
Gette, second-string tackle, was shoved into the
line between Cutts and Thurston. Le Gette had the
weight and the size and he soon showed that he had
the fight. It was not certain that Towne would not
be back for the Pearsall game, but tonsillitis, if you
have it severely enough, can play hob with you, and
even if Wally was able to enter the final contest it
was doubtful that he would be able to play it
through; and just now the doctor’s report was far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
from reassuring. So Coach Haynes set about the
development of a new guard, to the chagrin of several
substitutes for that position, and, recalling the
fact that, with Towne out of the game, there’d be a
dearth of goal kickers, looked about him for likely
material. In the end, it was Le Gette who seemed
the most promising. Tasker would have to do the
bulk of the punting and, while he might add to his
field goal ability by hard practice, it seemed neither
wise nor fair to add to his duties. Le Gette had
done some punting the year before on the second
team as substitute fullback, and so the coach’s choice
fell on him.</p>

<p>Stuart, well wrapped in a big gray blanket against
the chill wind that was sweeping across the field, was
watching the first and second plugging away down
by the thirty-yard line at the far end of the field when
some one seated himself on the bench beside him.
Stuart, interested in seeing the result of Tasker’s
effort to punt into the teeth of the wind, didn’t turn
his head until Mr. Haynes’s voice startled him.</p>

<p>“Harven,” the coach was saying, “how are you
fixed for time in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Time?” Stuart looked rather blank for an instant,
trying to focus his thoughts. It was a trifle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
disconcerting to find the coach’s eyes on a level with
his at a distance of two feet.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better explain what I’m after,” continued
the other. “We need another man who can
kick goals, Harven. If Towne shouldn’t make the
Pearsall game we’d be in a fix. If you were playing
I’d not worry, but, to be candid, you may not
be.” He paused, but Stuart, turning his gaze away,
only nodded. “We need another man, if only to be
on the safe side,” Mr. Haynes resumed. “I know
that a week is a mighty short time to work in, but
I think that if you gave an hour to the business in
the mornings and perhaps a half hour in the afternoons
you could come pretty close to giving us a
new goal kicker. A good deal would depend on the
other chap, of course, but I’ve got a fellow who has
done some punting and who is willing to learn. He
was on the second last year and I’ve frankly told
him that his chance of getting into the big game
depends on his ability to kick goals fairly well.
You’ll find him eager to learn, Harven. I’d take
him in hand myself, but I’m no kicker and never was,
and I wouldn’t be able to teach him half as well as
you will. Now what do you say?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll do what I can, sir,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Stuart soberly and a bit stiffly. “I can find an hour
every morning, if my time suits the other fellow’s.
Is it certain that Towne won’t be able to play?”</p>

<p>“No, but we’ve got to be prepared. We may
never have a chance to score from the field in that
game, but we want to have the goods if the chance
does come.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Who is the fellow, Mr. Haynes?”</p>

<p>“Le Gette,” replied the coach promptly.</p>

<p>Stuart looked startled. “Steve Le Gette?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “Yes, I’m trying him at
guard in Towne’s place and I think he’ll fit. I’ll tell
him to see you after practice and you can fix a time
for the instruction I hope.”</p>

<p>Stuart was frowning at his scarred hands. “We—he
and I aren’t very friendly, sir,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“I know that, but this is a time when such things
don’t matter, Harven,” answered the other quietly.
“Each of you has a duty to perform for the team.
Personal differences can be forgotten for an hour
or so each day, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Stuart was silent a moment. Then: “I can do
it if he can,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Good!” Mr. Haynes stretched out his hand and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Stuart had put his in it before he realized what was
happening. He even grinned a little in response to
the coach’s smile. Afterwards he told himself that
he wished Haynes wasn’t so keen on hand-shaking.
“Much obliged, Harven,” the coach went on.
“Don’t spare Le Gette. He’s game for all you can
pile on to him. See what you can do in a week. If
you think I can help, let me know, but I shan’t butt
in on you. It’s up to you and Le Gette.” He
nodded and hurried off down the side line.</p>

<p>When the second period started Stuart took
Wheaton’s place at quarter and, it seemed to him,
did better than he had done any day since his return.
He was not confident enough to carry the ball himself,
although had he tried a quarterback run in one
instance and made it good he might have added another
six points to the first team’s score. But he
ran the team with not a little of his old brilliance,
and Coach Haynes, following the plays, smiled
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The meeting of Stuart and Le Gette was extremely
polite and formal. They walked back to the gymnasium
together and compared schedules, finding
that on every day save Tuesday it would be possible
to get an hour together on the field. On Tuesday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
they fixed on a half hour, possibly forty minutes,
following breakfast. They parted with mutual relief
on the gymnasium steps.</p>

<p>There was a most enthusiastic cheer meeting that
evening, and Stuart and Neil attended, although the
former tried to get out of it. New songs and old
songs were sung, every one who had the courage to
face that sea of faces and could think of anything
to say made a speech. There was wild and noisy
applause on every provocation and the cheering was
deafening. Neil, noting that Stuart’s name brought
as vociferous a response as any, glowed
proudly.</p>

<p>On their way out of the hall Stuart collided with
Mr. Moffit and the instructor took him by the arm
and led him aside. “You didn’t come back to report,”
he accused smilingly. Stuart grinned. “I
meant to, sir, but I couldn’t make it. I suppose
you’ve heard——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I was very glad, Harven. It is always
a satisfaction to one to learn that one’s prophesies
have been—er—correct. You see, I expected you
to go back on the team and laid a wager with myself
that you would. It pleases me to win. I thank
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Stuart laughed. “You took chances, sir. I didn’t
think I would go back.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, my boy, I was betting on a sure
thing. I was rather ashamed to take that end of the
wager: it was almost like cheating myself. You
see, Harven, what we think and what we think we
think are frequently very different thoughts. Well,
the best of luck to you!” The instructor nodded
and smiled and was borne on and Stuart joined Neil
again. As he steadied the latter through the throng
at the entrance he said with conviction:</p>

<p>“Miss Muffit’s a mighty decent old guy, Neil.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Neil. “Every one is when we
think so.”</p>

<p>Stuart’s rôle as teacher of the gentle art of kicking
field goals began the next forenoon. He had
grimly determined to follow Mr. Haynes’s instructions
and not spare the pupil, and, as they crossed to
the second team gridiron, he announced:</p>

<p>“Haynes tells me that you want to learn, Le Gette,
and that I’m to teach you. I wasn’t crazy to take
the job, as you can guess, but I did take it and I’m
going to do my best with it. What I’m trying to
get at is just this.” He stopped and scowled sternly.
“You’ve got to work if anything’s to come of this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
and I’m going to see that you do work. But you’re
not to think that I’m—I’m trying to put anything
over on you. I’m doing this for Haynes—I mean
for the team, and it won’t get us anywhere if you
grouch or sulk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” answered Le Gette. “I’m
not any crazier about this than you are, but if you
keep your shirt on I’ll do the same. And I’ll take
all the work you can give me, Harven. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>After half an hour Stuart concluded that it was
going to be less a matter of the teacher’s not sparing
the pupil than of the pupil’s not sparing the teacher.
Le Gette was a veritable whale for work, and all
Stuart’s admonitions to take time were wasted. Le
Gette spared neither himself nor Stuart. And he
proved an apt student, too. Stuart had to acknowledge
that. He listened to what was told him, copied
the other’s methods and got results. A knowledge
of punting aided to some extent, but drop-kicking
is an art by itself and the pupil had much to learn.
When the hour was up and they had to hurry back
to the campus, Stuart couldn’t have said whether he
or Le Gette was the more exhausted! In the afternoon
there was a brief half hour after the Williston
game was over, but as Le Gette had played through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
most of that contest he wasn’t in very good shape
for his lesson. For that matter, neither was Stuart,
for he, too, had participated. Both were glad
enough when the darkness put an end to the session.
They went back to the gymnasium in the twilight,
crossing the deserted first team gridiron in silence
until, just short of the lighted windows of the building
ahead, Le Gette said feelingly:</p>

<p>“A shower isn’t going to be so rotten, eh?”</p>

<p>And Stuart answered, almost amiably: “You
said something!”</p>

<p>The Williston game had resulted about as predicted.
The visitors had proved rather more formidable
than expected, perhaps, and Coach Haynes
had been forced to use most of his first-string players
well into the third period. The exceptions were
Whaley and Wheaton. The right end had been
roughly used in a tackle and had given way to Wesner
in the second period and Wheaton had yielded
to Stuart soon after the beginning of the third quarter.
Stuart had done well enough; had run the
team fast and surely, had recovered a fumble of
Tasker’s that might have resulted disastrously and
had pulled off three perfect heaves to Tom Muirgart.
But as for “stunts” Stuart simply wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
there. Those old-time quarterback runs for thirty,
forty, sometimes sixty yards were missing. Only
once during the time he had played had he dared
attempt a run and then he had been spilled promptly
for a two-yard loss. On the whole, though, the
Cherry-and-Gray had played a hard, snappy game
against a doughty opponent, and the final score of
19 to 6 was generally considered satisfactory.
There were those who maintained that Williston
should not have scored, but there are always pessimists
in every community.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<small>THE CONFERENCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">After Breakfast Sunday morning Jack appeared
at Number 12 Lacey with a big
bundle of newspapers under his arm. It
was his first call for over a week and, had Neil been
absent, there might have been an appreciable restraint
in the atmosphere. But Neil saved the situation,
and in a minute the conversation was going
smoothly enough. Jack was full of the football
news, dumping all save the sporting sections of the
Sunday papers on the floor, and read aloud the story
of the Pearsall—St. Charles game, which Pearsall
had captured by the staggering score of 39 to 0.
Stuart forgot his grievances in surprise and concern.</p>

<p>“Golly! That’s three scores more than we made
against them! It’s double what we did! St. Charles
must have been ’way off her game, Jack. You can’t
tell me that Pearsall is that much better than we
are.”</p>

<p>But the story held nothing to confirm his theory.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
St. Charles was credited with having played hard
and with having made few mistakes. “I guess Pearsall’s
better than we thought she was,” said Jack
gloomily. “We didn’t find those St. Charles ends
very easy, but Pearsall seems to have run them about
as she pleased! Look at some of her gains: ‘Connor
made seven outside left tackle’; ‘Morton, faking
a throw to Cooper, ran around right end for sixteen
yards, St. Charles’ defense having fallen for the
bluff’; ‘Loring failed at the center, but on the next
try went outside tackle on the left and carried the
pigskin to the twenty-eight yards’; ‘Connor got
around right end again for six, but a penalty for
off-side took the ball back to the forty-one yards.’
Say, that Connor must be some guy!”</p>

<p>“Who went over to the game for us?” asked
Stuart.</p>

<p>“Hanson and Joe Jakin.”</p>

<p>“What do they say?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard yet. They’re going to report
this afternoon. They didn’t get back until late last
night. There was a freight smash-up down the line
and their train was held up. By the way, in case I
forget it, there’s a conference at Haynes’s Tuesday
night and he wants you to be sure and come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“Me?” Stuart looked surprised. “Oh, well, I
guess I wouldn’t be much use,” he added after a
pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, you would. There’ll be about eight of us
and we’re going over the final plans. I’ll look for
you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll get there,” answered Stuart with
elaborate carelessness.</p>

<p>“You will,” said Neil decidedly. “You’ll get
there if I have to carry you!”</p>

<p>Jack laughed, and after a moment of indecision
Stuart managed a grin. Then they returned to the
subject of the Pearsall—St. Charles game and
thrashed it all out, if not to their satisfaction at any
rate most exhaustively. When Jack took his departure,
his precious papers under his arm again,
Stuart’s “So long, Jack,” was almost cordial.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Stuart went over to the infirmary
and called on Wally Towne. He spent only a few
minutes with the patient, however, for Towne was
not up to talking much, and the nurse discouraged a
longer visit. Towne was certain that he’d be all
right for the Pearsall game, but, secretly, Stuart
doubted it. Nor could he find anything in the
nurse’s expression to bear out Towne’s assertion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
He left the room convinced that if there were any
field-goals scored on Saturday next they would not
be scored by poor old Wally!</p>

<p>Monday was rather an off day on the gridiron so
far as the regulars were concerned. Stuart had
some fifteen minutes with a first team that was
largely substitutes, and the second managed to tie
the game at 6 to 6. But so far as the education of
Le Gette was concerned Monday was not an off day
at all. There was a round sixty minutes of work in
the morning and, because practice was shortened,
a good forty-five in the afternoon. Le Gette already
showed progress, and Stuart acknowledged the fact
to the pupil on the way back from the field at dusk.
Perhaps his words sounded more grudging than he
really felt, for Le Gette laughed and answered:
“Don’t say it if it hurts you, Harven.” Whereupon
Stuart fell into a silence and wondered if punching
the other on the nose would really yield him all the
satisfaction he thought it would!</p>

<p>Tuesday the players put their noses back on the
grindstone and Coach Haynes turned it fast and
unremittingly. When the second team came over
and the scrimmage started both sides realized that
to-day’s battle was going to be real and earnest, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
although neither Mr. Haynes nor “Old Unabridged”
so much as suggested it by word, look or gesture,
fur began to fly right away. A day of rest or light
work for the first team regulars had put them on
their mettle and, paraphrasing the old story, they
were determined that no second team could bite
them and live! It was a hot, scrappy affair from
the first whistle to the ten-minute intermission, and,
from the intermission on to the last panting moment
when, with their backs to the goal line, the first team
warriors repelled the second for the fourth time inside
the five-yard line, praying for the whistle.
Nominally it ended in a victory for the first, 7 to 6,
but virtually it was a tie, for that margin of one
point was there only by reason that the second possessed
no player with half the ability of Joe Cutts to
kick a goal from placement.</p>

<p>Stuart played through the second period—they
played two halves of fifteen minutes each—and
worked hard. If he didn’t cover himself with glory
he at least managed to get fairly well sprinkled with
gore, for a second team end put an elbow against
his nose in a heated moment of the contest, and life
was going far too hectically just then for the administration
of first aid. When the flow was staunched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Stuart would have been denied admittance at any
respectable abattoir! But that was all in the day’s
work, and a puffy nose soon responds to the proper
treatment, and, anyhow, they’d stopped the second
four times inside the five yards! Still, Stuart felt
the pace and showed it when the game was done,
and Le Gette, himself a dirt-smeared, short-winded,
disreputable object, took one brief look at his instructor
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“It can’t be done,” he said. “Let’s call it off,
Harven.”</p>

<p>And Stuart, wanting to act the Trojan but sensing
the call of the showers, nodded as reluctantly as he
could, arose and limped off on the trail of the others.</p>

<p>It was while The Laird was delicately administering
to his enlarged and ensanguined nose that
Stuart asked perplexedly: “Say what’s the matter
with me, anyhow, Mac?”</p>

<p>The Laird tossed a wad of absorbent cotton into
the basin and replied, “Naught, lad. There’s no
break there. ’Twill be fine to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, I don’t mean my nose,” responded
Stuart impatiently, “and you know it. I mean,
what’s the reason I can’t play worth a hang any
more? You’ve seen how it is, Mac. I’m not half as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
good as I was. I can’t play as well as I could at the
beginning of last season! Something’s wrong, and
I can’t put my finger on it!”</p>

<p>“Eating all right?” asked the trainer.</p>

<p>“Sure. Eating enough, anyway. Sometimes
things don’t taste so good, but—oh, it isn’t that.
I’m all right that way. Nothing wrong with me.
I mean——”</p>

<p>“Don’t think about it, lad.” The trainer wiped
his hands carefully and returned things to the
shelves. “No one can lay off as long as you did
and not break his stride. Given another week or
ten days, you’d come back fine.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got another week,” protested
Stuart. “There’s only three days! And I’ve been
back a whole week already and I’m no better than
I was when I started!”</p>

<p>“I know,” The Laird nodded sympathetically.
“It’s too bad, but I’d not greet. You’re doing your
best, lad, and we all know it, and there’s no more
any one can do.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s mighty funny,” growled Stuart. “I’m
fit as ever and I know all the football I ever knew,
but—but I can’t—can’t deliver the goods! I get
sort of scared, Mac. I’m afraid to try anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
myself for fear I’ll make a mess of it. The other
day I almost fumbled!”</p>

<p>“What of it? There’s others have fumbled and
lived to spring an alibi!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I never fumbled but once, and you
know it: in a game, I mean. And it frightened me,
Mac.”</p>

<p>“You think too much, lad, and it’s making you
nervous. Forget football for a couple of days.
And to-morrow, when you go in, give the ball to
yourself and prove you’re just as good as ever you
were.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be, though,” answered Stuart
gloomily. “I’d make a botch of it. I haven’t got
the sand any more, Mac.”</p>

<p>“Try it, just the same, lad. If you get stopped
there’s no great harm done. But try it. That’s the
only way to tell. There you are. Give the nose a
good bath in cold water to-night and again in the
morning. The lad that handed you that must have
near sprained his elbow, I’m thinking!”</p>

<p>Stuart took his damaged countenance to Coach
Haynes’ at half-past seven that evening and afforded
more or less merriment to the others present at the
conference. There were seven of the players there:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Jack, Tom Muirgart, Beeman, Wheaton, Howdy
Tasker, Leo Burns and Stuart. And The Laird
sat in a dim corner and smoked his pipe incessantly
and spoke only to answer questions. Fred Locker
came in later, out of breath and apologetic. Stuart
took small part in the discussion that lasted well
over an hour and a half, although both Jack and
the coach by word and manner invited his opinions.
The fact was that Stuart would willingly have given
his opinions had he had any, but, to his surprise, he
found that, save on one or two subjects alone he
had formulated none. It was Jack who, aside from
Mr. Haynes, had supplied suggestion and criticism,
who had, it appeared, really given thought to the
questions that arose. For the first time Stuart
realized how far short of perfect his conception of a
captain’s duties had been, and he felt a new, and
slightly envious, respect for Jack.</p>

<p>Coach Haynes was very frank in comparing
Manning and Pearsall and made no attempt to spare
any one’s feelings. “I don’t think Pearsall has
much if anything on us in the rush line. Maybe
Walworth is a bit cleverer than Cutts. He’s a good
example of the light, quick-moving center, very
shifty and a hard man to handle on offense. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
right guard is a remarkably good one, too, and Le
Gette will have his hands full. As to ends, I’m not
troubling. Our scouts report that Cooper, who
played left end for them, was boxed time and again
Saturday. Of course, we can’t count much on that,
for that fault will probably be largely corrected.
It’s when we come to the backfield that the comparison
goes against us, fellows. There’s no doubt
that, as the two teams played three days ago, Pearsall
has a faster, heavier and more aggressive set of
backs than we have. Connor, their right half, is an
unusually fine player. He made most of their running
gains for them and did a lot better against the
St. Charles ends than we did. Morton, fullback, is
big and heavy and hard to stop. He failed to gain
just three times against St. Charles when he bucked
the line. At runs outside tackles he’s a bit slow.
Loring, the left half, is good but not so dangerous
as Connor. Their quarter is experienced and runs
off a fast game. He seldom carries the ball himself.</p>

<p>“Pearsall will use about the same plays she used
last year, from all the information we have. She
has probably a couple of aces up her sleeve, but so
have we. She hasn’t developed forward passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
much and hasn’t been very successful so far with
that style of game. Her punters are ordinarily
good. There are weird stories of Loring having
made sixty yards frequently in practice but he’s
never shown anything of the sort in public. There’s
no doubt, however, that he owes his place on the
team more to his punting ability than to his running.
So it may be that he’s the nigger in the woodpile.”</p>

<p>“You think then, sir,” asked Muirgart, “that
Pearsall has the edge on us?”</p>

<p>“Surely. I think she’s at least six points better
than we are to-day. Mind you, though, I say <em>to-day</em>,
Muirgart. Next Saturday’s another day.
Frankly, I’d rather go into a game of this sort with
the odds against us a bit. We’ll realize that we’ve
got to fight harder and we’ll do it. We can beat
Pearsall. I don’t say that just as a bluff. I mean
it. We can beat her and we’re going to. We’re
going to do it by getting the jump on her right at
the start, by making no mistakes and by always,
everlastingly trying a little bit harder than she does!
Every fellow must go into the game with the determination
to outplay his opponent and the conviction
that if he really tries hard he can do it. Fellows,
I’ve seen teams that were admittedly two scores<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
weaker than their opponents go in and fight and
fight and win. I’ve seen it time and again. It’s
spirit that does the trick. Teach two teams the
same amount of football, have them physically even
and put them on the field. What’s going to happen?
A tie game? Not once in ten times! One team or
the other will have the better spirit and will win the
game! Well, let’s get down to business.”</p>

<p>They went over the plays then, discussing, arguing.
Every play was judged with relation to Pearsall’s
style of defense and her success against such
plays during the season. In the end nineteen only
were retained. As each could be pulled off at both
right and left of center Manning would have at
her disposal thirty-eight variations. All reasonable
contingencies were brought up and disposed of.
Stuart was questioned regarding Le Gette’s probable
usefulness as a field goal kicker and gave an encouraging
report. “He ought to be tried out in a
game to-morrow, though, Mr. Haynes,” Stuart
added. “Kicking a goal is a different thing when
half a dozen wild Indians are charging through on
top of you!”</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for the word from you,” replied
the coach. “We’ll give him a trial to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
and every other day until Saturday. What’s the
news of Towne, by the way, Laird?”</p>

<p>The Laird took his pipe out of his mouth and
shook his head.</p>

<p>“He’ll not play, Coach, save you put him in at the
end for a bit. And I’m thinking that’s not so wise,
for he has his letter already.”</p>

<p>Stuart walked back to school with Jack and Fred
Locker and said little on the way. The evening’s
proceedings had left him feeling extremely unimportant,
and the feeling wasn’t an agreeable one.
The manager left them to look in at the mass meeting
which, as was evident from the sounds that
came from the assembly hall in Manning, was still
in progress, and Stuart and Jack paused at the corner
of Lacey. There was silence between them for
a moment, and then Stuart said impulsively: “Jack,
it was a mighty good thing they dished me and made
you captain. You’ve got the brain for it, and I
hadn’t. I didn’t realize it until to-night.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” said Jack indignantly. “Besides, brain—or
what you mean by that—isn’t the only thing a
captain needs, Stuart. The right sort of football
captain needs what I haven’t got and never could
get.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“What?” asked Stuart.</p>

<p>Jack shook his head. “I don’t know how to put
it into words. It isn’t exactly popularity, and—leadership
isn’t quite it. Those things are part of it,
though. I read about a fellow who was a captain
over in France in the War. He wasn’t popular exactly.
Some of his men loved him but a lot more
fairly hated him. But they all <em>believed</em> in him,
Stuart, and they’d have followed him to—to Berlin,
and cheered all the way! I guess that’s about what
I’m trying to get at. What that fellow had is what
I haven’t got and what you have, Stuart.”</p>

<p>“I have?” muttered Stuart. “I don’t think I
knew it, Jack.” He was silent a moment. Then
with a little laugh that held more of bitterness
than amusement, he added: “If I had, I’ve surely
lost it. No one would follow me to-day as far as
the door there!”</p>

<p>“You failed them, Stuart,” answered the other
gravely. “But they’ll come back when you say the
word.”</p>

<p>“Come back? Oh—well—I guess there won’t be
any coming back. I suppose I did play the fool,
Jack. Just the same, I guess it was better for the
team. You’re a better captain than I was or could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
have been. I—I haven’t been awfully decent lately,
and—well, you might forget it, if you don’t mind,
and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” said Jack gruffly. “Go to the
dickens, will you? Good night, you poor simp!”</p>

<p>Stuart found Number 12 in darkness. Neil, he
reflected, was probably over at the cheer meeting.
Neil had a sentimental streak in him and loved to
get choked up and moist-eyed listening to the Glee
Club sing “Old Manning!” Stuart didn’t light up
just then, but pulled a chair to the window and put
his feet on the window seat and looked across at the
lights in Meigs and thought over what Jack had
said and what had happened during the evening
and a lot of things. When Neil came in later he
found him still there.</p>

<p>“Hello,” Neil exclaimed, “what’s your trouble?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve been trying to discover,” answered
Stuart soberly.</p>

<small>LE GETTE EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The cold spell continued well into the middle
of the week, with brisk winds from the
northwest and, if rumor was to be credited,
a momentary flurry of snow Tuesday evening.
The clicking of the steam in the pipes had a pleasant
sound those mornings when, leaping heroically from
bed, one slammed the window down, hustled shiveringly
into a bathrobe and scuttled along the corridor
to the showers. Once inside the swinging doors,
the warm steam-laden atmosphere drove out the
chills and almost invariably, for some reason, induced
song. Disrobed figures, darting in or out of
the showers, sang lustily. Robed figures, awaiting
their turns, sang, too. As one had to drown the
sound of the spray and his neighbors’ voices in order
to hear and appreciate his own vocal efforts, the
lavatories were so many Babels. At this season
football songs were in favor, and a stranger listening
outside could not have failed to be convinced of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
Manning’s might and valor and of the futility of
Pearsall’s pretensions!</p>

<p>But one didn’t have to listen outside the lavatories
to hear football pæans those days. Every
one sang them or whistled them, in hall, on campus,
along the village street. Already the big cherry-red
banner with the gray M floated beneath the
stars-and-stripes from the flagpole in front of Manning
Hall and dormitory windows were showing
crossed pennants or cherry-colored pillows. In the
village the storekeepers were digging out last season’s
surplus of flags and megaphones and arm
bands, and over the portal of the town hall the ancient
and faded length of red and gray bunting was
once more in place. In short, Safford was preparing
for the big event that came but once in two years
and scorned expense! It was even said that Mr.
Hutchins—familiarly known throughout school as
“Blinky”—had recklessly imported from New York
a whole dozen cherry-and-gray four-in-hands the
like of which had never been seen in Safford and,
which was even more certain, would never be seen
at Manning! But, although fellows shied from the
ties, they considered that “Blinky” had been very
sporting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>Cheer meetings were held nightly, increasing in
fervor as the big game approached. Unknown to
fame indeed was he who by Friday night had not
stood at least once on the platform in assembly hall
and voiced his faith in the team! Fellows who
never read a newspaper save on Sunday, and then
confined themselves to the magazine and “comic”
sections, hurried to the village after breakfast and
meandered back to the campus with their faces concealed
behind the outspread pages of the morning
journals. Studious youths who had hitherto been
uncertain whether a touchback was a player or an
article of football attire became suddenly versed in
the rules of the game to the point of argument, and
Nutting, who kept the stationery store, sold the
four rules-books that had caused him sorrow for
nearly two years! In fact, Manning School was
undergoing a recurrent malady known as football
fever and was experiencing it in its most virulent
form.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, however, the malady had not
reached its height, and morning recitations were
fairly normal; something not to be said of Thursday’s
or Friday’s. Stuart and Le Gette put in the
usual practice session on the second team gridiron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
and Le Gette did seven goals out of ten tries by drop
kicking and four out of ten from placement. When
work was over Stuart announced that the other
would have a chance to show what he could do
against the second team that afternoon. If Stuart
expected signs of trepidation in Le Gette he was disappointed.
Le Gette only nodded and said: “I
suppose you’ve got to forget the other fellows and
just keep your mind on the kick.”</p>

<p>Stuart had no better advice to offer.</p>

<p>When the trials came Le Gette didn’t do so badly.
The first time, called back from guard position to try
a drop kick from second’s thirty, he showed nervousness
but, since his line held fast, he put the pigskin
over. A few minutes later, however, on a second
attempt, an opposing tackle leaked through and hurried
him and the ball went slewing off to a corner of
the field. Again he made good, from close to the
twenty, and, just before the end came, he failed
miserably at a placement kick after touchdown.
Afterwards, Stuart kept him out until it was too
dark to see the ball, and, with an eager junior chasing
the pigskin for them, drilled Le Gette in placement
kicking so strenuously that all hands, including
the willing junior, were thoroughly fagged out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
But on Thursday Le Gette showed improvements
both at morning practice and during the game with
the second, and Stuart felt a deal of pride in the
results of his coaching, even before Mr. Haynes
sought him on the bench and congratulated him.</p>

<p>“You’ve done wonders, Harven,” said the coach
earnestly. “You’ve pulled us out of a hole. No
doubt about that. Le Gette’s as good right now as
Towne. I’m mighty grateful to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” muttered Stuart. “He’s
worked like a Trojan, Le Gette has. I’ll say that
for him.”</p>

<p>“I guess you both have,” answered the coach
warmly. “Perhaps you’d better ease up to-morrow.
Mustn’t overdo it.”</p>

<p>“No fear, sir. Le Gette’s a whale for work.
He’ll be twenty per cent better Saturday. I’m
going to keep him right at it until the last
minute.”</p>

<p>“We—ell, all right. Maybe you know best.
See that he gets a good rubbing afterwards.” Mr.
Haynes nodded and hurried off, leaving Stuart
frowning after him. The frown was occasioned
by the unwelcome realization that the coach’s commendation
had pleased him, and Stuart didn’t want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
to be pleased by anything the coach said or did.</p>

<p>There was a stiff, grueling practice that afternoon,
in which the first team rose in its might and, to use
Billy Littlefield’s picturesque metaphor, “chewed the
ear off the goats.” Which meant that the first
stacked up fourteen points in the first period and
twelve in the second, and that all the second could do
was drop a rather lucky field goal from the thirty-five
yards, aided by a brisk wind. Stuart played
all of that second half and played about as usual.
In spite of The Laird’s advice, he had not dared to
put himself to the test. It was all well enough for
The Laird to say that if he was stopped it didn’t
matter, but it did matter. The first was on its mettle
those days and a win over the second was something
greatly to be desired, and Stuart never found
a time when, in his judgment, to risk the loss of
territory or, possibly the ball, would have been permissible.
So he fed the pigskin to the other backs
or shied it over the line to a waiting end and never
attempted to gain the glory of a spurt outside of
tackle or a “knife” through the line.</p>

<p>Thursday’s work-out was the last before the
Pearsall game, although there was some signal and
formation drill on Friday and a short session for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
the kickers. The second disbanded with much
cheering and romped joyously off the field, elation
over the end of a season’s martyrdom overweighing
the degradation of a 26 to 3 defeat. That was
Thursday. Friday Stuart and Le Gette got in an
hour in the forenoon and an hour before twilight,
and Le Gette kicked fourteen out of a possible
twenty drops from various distances and at assorted
angles, and Stuart, unable to dissimilate any longer,
slapped his pupil on the back and exclaimed heartily:
“That’s booting ’em!”</p>

<p>That was when the afternoon’s session was over.
Le Gette, having rescued his sweater from the
ground faced Stuart with a broad grin. “I guess I
must be pretty good, Harven,” he replied, “to have
<em>you</em> say so!”</p>

<p>Stuart frowned. “Oh, I’m not such a pup as
that,” he protested. “You’ve done mighty well,
and—I’m fair enough to say so.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. All right. Let’s wander.” Then,
when they had gone a little way, he turned to Stuart
and said: “You’ve got it in for me for blackballing
young Orr, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Stuart, surprised, stared back an instant. Then:
“Yes, I have,” he answered coldly. “And if it’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
the same to you, Le Gette, we’ll keep off that subject.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. And I didn’t care a whoop. But
you’ve been pretty decent in this business, Harven,
and I guess I’d like to have you know that you’re
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Wrong? How am I wrong? Just because you
didn’t like me you needn’t have—”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses,” interrupted Le Gette calmly.
“You didn’t get me. I’m trying to tell you that I
didn’t vote against Orr.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of incredulous silence before
Stuart laughed sarcastically. “Go on, you’re doing
fine!” he sneered.</p>

<p>Le Gette flushed but kept his temper. “All
right,” he said. “If you take that tone, I’m
through.”</p>

<p>Stuart eyed him doubtfully. Then: “There’s no
use telling me that,” he expostulated. “I know you
did it. Who else was there?”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to find out,” Le Gette replied
shortly. “I’ve told you that I didn’t do it. Let’s
drop it.”</p>

<p>They went on towards the gymnasium in silence,
Stuart thinking hard. After a minute he said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
“All right, Le Gette, I believe you. Sorry if I was
rotten. But you looked at me funny that night,
and I knew you had it in for me——”</p>

<p>“Never did,” answered the other quickly. “Anyway,
not until you showed that you disliked me for
some reason. But no matter how I felt toward
you, Harven, I wouldn’t do a dirty trick like that.”</p>

<p>They had reached the steps, and Stuart paused.
“Wait a second,” he said. “I’d like to get this right.
It looks as if I’d made an awful fool of myself. I
never had anything against you, Le Gette; I mean
until that happened. You always looked sort of—of
sneery, and—well, I thought you didn’t like me.
Then, that night, you had a look— Maybe I imagined
it——”</p>

<p>“I guess I looked at you the way you looked at
me,” replied Le Gette gruffly. “You always seemed
to think I was a lump of dirt! I don’t say that I
was awfully cut-up about that blackballing, except
that I’ve always sort of liked Neil Orr, for it got
your goat for fair. But I didn’t do it, and I didn’t
like you thinking I did. That got me peeved and I
went on letting you think so.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Stuart helplessly, “it’s mighty
funny!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, if you don’t believe me!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that! I mean the whole thing’s
funny; me thinking you had it in for me and—and
blaming you for the blackballing. I—I’m sorry,
Le Gette. Honest, I am!”</p>

<p>“Well, I wanted you to know the truth,” muttered
the other.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you told me. I guess I owe you an
apology.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe so. Can’t blame you for
being peeved, the way things stood. Guess I ought
to have explained at the time, only I was too mad.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Stuart. Then, thoughtfully:
“I wish I knew who did it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind telling you, but I wouldn’t bother to
say anything about it to him because I gave him a
dressing down he won’t forget for awhile. It was
young Lantwood.”</p>

<p>“Austin Lantwood! But—why, I thought—”</p>

<p>“Oh, he didn’t have anything against you. It
was something that Orr had done. He didn’t tell
me what.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it! Neil never did anything
against any one! He’s the squarest fellow in
school! If Lantwood says that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it probably wasn’t anything really,” interrupted
Le Gette. “Lantwood’s more or less of a pill.
Anyway, he won’t do it again, and if you put Orr’s
name up next term there’s no doubt that he’ll make it
all right.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to,” answered Stuart. “How’d you
know it was Lantwood?”</p>

<p>“Sort of guessed it. Happened to see his face
when Severence announced the vote. Afterwards,
I followed him out and poked a fist at him and made
him come across. He’s yellow and only lied once.
Then I gave him a playful jolt in the ribs and he confessed.
It wasn’t any business of mine, I suppose,
but—well, maybe I thought I might want to square
myself some day. Say, let’s go in. I’m freezing to
death out here!”</p>

<p>“The little rat!” murmured Stuart as he followed
the other into the warmth of the gymnasium.</p>

<p>“All of that,” agreed Le Gette cheerfully. “But
I wouldn’t bother with him, Harven. I told him
I’d break his neck if he ever did anything like that
again. He won’t. Funny thing about it is he’s
taken rather a shine to me since then!”</p>

<p>Later, back in Number 12, Stuart asked: “Neil,
what did you ever do to Austin Lantwood?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>Neil marked a place in his book with a finger and
shook his head as he looked up. “Lantwood?
Why, nothing! That is—— Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Well, Le Gette’s just told me that it was Lantwood
who blackballed you for Lyceum.”</p>

<p>“Lantwood! Funny I didn’t think of him,”
mused Neil. “Well, I’m glad it wasn’t Le Gette,
anyway. You know, I didn’t think it was,
Stuart.”</p>

<p>“Lantwood told Le Gette that you’d done something
to him some time or other. What was it?”</p>

<p>Neil laughed. “Well, last spring I told him he
was a disgrace to the school, and a few things like
that, and I dare say he didn’t like it.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Why, I found him twisting a kid’s arm one afternoon
in the lower corridor in Manning. The kid
was a junior, about thirteen, I guess, and hardly up
to the other chap’s shoulder. He was crying and I
butted in. Lantwood said the kid had called him
names and I said I guessed he deserved it. He
wanted to scrap, and I couldn’t oblige him very well,
so I hauled off with one crutch and he beat it.
That’s all there was to it, except that I told him a
few things to think over!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be switched!” marveled Stuart.
“Think of little Neil’s losing his temper! Golly, I
didn’t think you could do it!”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I did just that,” replied Neil reflectively.
“I was indignant, I guess, but I don’t
think I was mad.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll never get mad at me, then,”
laughed Stuart. “I suppose when you’re really
angry you use <em>both</em> crutches!”</p>

<p>“No,” Neil shook his head smilingly, “when
I get really mad I don’t say anything.”</p>

<p>“Hope you remain chatty, old son. Well, Lantwood
won’t do it again, Steve says, and——”</p>

<p>“<em>Who</em> says?”</p>

<p>“Le Gette.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Neil hid the amusement in his eyes by
bending over his book again. “Well, I’m glad it
wasn’t Le Gette, Stuart.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” After a moment Stuart added: “He’s
not such a bad sort, Neil. I—I was sort of fooled
about him.”</p>

<p>“You sometimes are, you know,” agreed Neil
mildly.</p>

<p>“Well, when a fellow makes you think he doesn’t
like you——” Stuart paused. “I’m going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
put you up again for Lyceum right after Christmas
recess, and you’ll go through like a shot.”</p>

<p>“All right. Thanks. Now will you kindly let
me go ahead with this? Even if you never study,
I’ve got to occasionally!”</p>

<p>“What a rotten subject to mention,” groaned
Stuart. “I’m in a regular mess with Greek. But
a fellow simply can’t get his mind on things like that
in the last week of the season. After we’ve trimmed
Pearsall——” He stopped and was silent a
moment. Then: “Know something, Neil?” he
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Neil nodded without looking up again. “A little
something,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get licked Saturday,” announced
Stuart in dismal tones. “Something tells me so.”</p>

<p>“That so? What time is it?”</p>

<p>“Quarter to six—nearly.”</p>

<p>“Wait half an hour then and something will tell
you differently. I’ve always noticed that you’re a
bit of a pessimist just before mealtime!”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the dickens,” murmured Stuart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<small>TASKER GOES OVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Why, when he had already gone through
one Pearsall game, Stuart should have
awakened on the morning of November
twentieth with his heart in his mouth was beyond
him. But he did, and all the time he was dressing
and all through breakfast he felt jumpy and scared.
He managed to eat a normal amount of food, although
he didn’t want anything but a cup of coffee,
for fear that his table companions might surmise
the degrading fact that he was as nervous as any
tyro. It was a relief to get out of doors afterwards
and sit in the sunlight in front of Manning with
some of the fellows and wait for ten o’clock to arrive.
At ten he and Steve Le Gette were to have a
final session on the field. He wished now they had
decided to meet earlier.</p>

<p>The weather was well-nigh ideal for football;
bright, with scarcely a suggestion of breeze and the
thermometer around fifty. Perhaps by midday the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
sun might shine a bit too ardently, but just now it
was very welcome. There were almost no classes
this morning; none at all for the football players;
and the holiday feeling was apparent from the first.
Le Gette showed up a quarter of an hour before the
appointed time, to Stuart’s relief, and they went over
to the gymnasium and donned togs very leisurely.
There was no hurry now that the tedium of inactive
waiting was past. All either of the boys desired was
an occupation to take their minds from what was
scheduled to take place at two o’clock. They talked
freely to-day, and Steve Le Gette found that there
was quite a different side to Stuart Harven from
what he had known. Stuart explained Lantwood’s
grievance against Neil and from that subject the talk
slipped to Neil’s appointment as one of the day’s
cheer leaders, Le Gette wondering how he would
manage in view of his dependence on crutches.
Stuart was confident that Neil would have no
trouble, though. “He can do about everything any
one else can except walk,” he said. Then, as was
fated, the conversation reached the game and they
talked of it all the way over to the field and felt
better for it.</p>

<p>Practice wasn’t very hard this morning. Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
tried to make Le Gette more perfect in placement
kicking, but it was fairly evident that no amount of
practice would ever bring Le Gette’s place kicks to
a par with his drops. Of the latter he performed
several difficult ones, Stuart placing him at angles
such as would probably never occur in contests.
They were not alone this morning, for two or three
dozen fellows wandered over to the field and looked
on. Wallace Towne was one. Towne plainly
showed his recent illness, although he told Stuart
that he felt perfectly all right and hoped that Haynes
would let him into the game for a while.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t mind so much if it wasn’t my last
game,” he said. “You’ve got another year. But
I haven’t. Not here.”</p>

<p>“Still you’ve got your letter, old man,” consoled
Stuart.</p>

<p>“I know. That isn’t it. I want to smash a
couple of ‘Percies.’ Suppose you’ll get in, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Wally. I’m hoping Haynes will
let me in for a period. Guess that’s the best I can
expect. I’m playing rotten.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe it! You couldn’t. You’ll make
it. Wish I was half as certain!”</p>

<p>The advance guard of the enemy had begun to put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
in an appearance by the time Stuart and Le Gette got
back to the campus, and blue pennants and arm
bands were well in evidence. Luncheon for the
players was a lightweight affair at twelve, at which
there was far more talking than eating. Talk is a
splendid outlet for nervousness. After luncheon the
squad went to the gymnasium and walked through
half a dozen plays and listened to a final talk by the
coach. Like many of his kind, Mr. Haynes firmly
believed that the team scoring first was the team that
won. Perhaps later he changed his mind, but to-day
he still believed and shared his belief.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get the jump on Pearsall,” he explained.
“We’re going to try mighty hard to score
inside the first ten minutes. After we have scored
we’ll play a safe game, but until we have we’re going
to take chances and use every trick that will gain
ground. The first punch is what counts, fellows,
and we want to deliver it. I want to see Pearsall
played right off her feet in the first eight or ten
minutes. That means that every one of you must
show all the speed and all the snap you know, and
a bit more besides. There’s to be no time called, no
hesitation about signals. Every man must keep on
the jump every minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>Manning went over to the field at half-past one.
Already the stands were well sprinkled. The townsfolk
had showed their allegiance by turning out in
their bravest array, many of them bringing lunch
along so that they might be early on hand and secure
the best seats. The yearly circus and the Manning-Pearsall
football game were the only events capable
of inducing Safford citizens outside their doors.
Pearsall romped on a few minutes later, by which
time there was a sufficient number of her adherents
in place to give her a rousing welcome. That event
started the cheering which continued without respite
until the teams took the field. Down in front of the
Manning sections, Stearns Wilson, cheer captain,
and McColl, Trenholme and Neil Orr, his lieutenants,
swung their big cherry-colored megaphones
and worked hard. The way in which Neil danced
about on his crutches and waved his arms was a
wonder and a delight, and it is no exaggeration to
say that, although his section held a goodly number
of visitors sprinkled in with the students, he obtained
quite as good results as any of the other
leaders.</p>

<p>The day had turned just a little too warm for the
comfort of the warriors, but the absence of wind was
something to be thankful for and atoned for the excess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
of temperature. The Pearsall squad, some
thirty strong, looked hard and eager. Statistics
gave the visitors a two pound advantage in the rushline
and placed the backfield average at the same
figure. Five minutes before two Captain Brewton
led his squad to the bench and Coach Haynes
summoned Stuart.</p>

<p>“Harven,” he announced, “you’re going to start
at quarter. I think you can run the team somewhat
faster than Wheaton, and speed is what we want.
You know the plays. Make them go and make them
go fast. I want a score—a touchdown if we can get
it, a field goal if we can’t—inside of ten minutes.
If we haven’t got it then, you come out, Harven.”</p>

<p>“If we have got it, sir?”</p>

<p>“You play the half through, barring accidents.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. We’ll have it if it’s to be had.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> to be had, Harven, and I want you to feel
so. There are two things to keep in mind every
minute. One is accuracy and the other is speed.
Get your plays right and then make them go fast.
Get the jump from the kick-off and never lose it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“That’s all I ask, Harven. Your best is mighty
good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>But, although Stuart had spoken confidently
enough to the coach, he was filled with misgivings
when he trotted out on the gridiron with a thundering
cheer beating against his ears. Ten minutes
was but ten minutes, and, unfortunately, Pearsall
had won the toss and given Manning the kick-off.
He was not through being surprised at his good
fortune when Joe Cutts stepped forward and shot
the pigskin away from the tee. He had hoped to get
into the game for a little while; perhaps for a
whole period toward the end; but that he should have
been chosen in preference to Wheaton to start the
game was something almost miraculous. Well,
there he was, and Haynes looked for a score in the
first ten minutes of playing time, which, thought
Stuart as he raced down the field behind the ball,
was a good deal to expect! But that wasn’t saying
it couldn’t be done. No, sir, not by a long shot!
Those chaps weren’t any better than old Manning.
Maybe not so good. Haynes had said that it was
spirit that counted——</p>

<p>Just then Stuart went slam into a Pearsall tackle,
a whistle shrilled and on the Blue’s seventeen yards a
carroty-haired half whom Stuart recognized as
Connor rolled off the ball and scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>Pearsall tested the Manning center for a yard,
massed her whole backfield on Thurston for two
more, gained three through Beeman and then punted.
It was Billy Littlefield, playing back with Stuart,
who caught, and Billy reeled off most of ten yards
before he was toppled. Then, with the two teams
facing each other across Manning’s forty-five, the
Cherry-and-Gray began an onslaught that became
history.</p>

<p>Statistics, if there was such, would show that
ninety-nine times in one hundred the first attack by a
team in an important game is made at the line.
Ninety-seven times in a hundred the second play is
also directed at the line. In short, the attempt is
almost invariably made to try out the opposing defense
in the first minutes of play. This rule is almost
as inviolable as the law of gravitation. Recently,
however, a famous scientist has shown that
even the law of gravitation has its exceptions, and it
is possible that knowledge of this fact may have emboldened
a lesser scientist—for who dares say that
football is not a science?—to conceive of an exception
to the rule alluded to. All that as may have
been, the rule was flagrantly disregarded. Instead
of sending a back experimentally against the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
line, Stuart watched the ball pass by him into the outspread
hands of Leo Burns, saw the whole backfield,
from balanced formation, dash to the right, saw the
Pearsall end neatly boxed by Tasker and Littlefield
and saw Burns tearing over the line. I say that
Stuart saw all this, but it would be nearer the facts
to say that he saw some of it and sensed the rest.
For Stuart was busy himself. While Whaley
blocked the opposing tackle, Le Gette and Stuart
cleaned out a hole that wasn’t used and met the first
onslaught of the enemy’s backs. Burns, running
wide and without interference, took the pigskin over
four white marks before he was pulled down by the
Pearsall quarter. The ball was near the enemy’s
forty-three when it came to light again.</p>

<p>Pearsall looked bewildered, even stunned. More
than that, she looked hurt and injured, as though
Manning had played an unfair trick on her. She
had had her rush line all set, every husky player from
tackle to tackle swinging and crouched, ready to
repel the attack. And what had the enemy done?
What, indeed, but outrage and transgress one of the
fundamental rules and precedents and go scurrying
off around an unsuspecting end! Pearsall was surprised,
disgruntled and sore. The thing was never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
done, and Manning had done it! But the Blue had
scant time to nurse her grievance, for never had a
team sped back to positions and cried its signals as
quickly as Manning did in the ensuing five seconds.
The Pearsall quarter fairly had to run to get back up
the field ere the ball again went into play. And in
those few seconds the Manning stand was a bedlam
of cheers unmeasured but thunderous.</p>

<p>Again <a href="#i_frontis">Stuart sent the ball to Burns on a direct
pass</a> and again Burns crossed to the right. But this
time the play went outside the tackle, and, because
Cooper, the Pearsall left end, eluded the interference
and managed to get himself in the way, the down
netted but three yards, and it was Pearsall’s turn to
cheer. But that was only a momentary pause in the
advance. Littlefield found a hole awaiting him between
guard and tackle and slashed through for
three more, and Tasker, faking a punt, went hurtling
into and over the opposing right tackle and, fighting,
squirming, head-down, took the ball for the rest of
the distance before the secondary defense piled on to
him.</p>

<p>Pearsall, confused by the opponent’s speed, tried
desperately to stem the tide, tried to meet speed with
speed and failed. She was still dismayed by that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
first act of treachery, puzzled by a foe who did the
unexpected and kept on doing it. She had been
assured that Manning was an exponent of old-style
football who would buck the line so long as a foot
rewarded her. But Manning didn’t seem to realize
that Pearsall had a center and was apparently only
partly aware of the existence of her guards! There
was little time for conferences, for Manning leaped
from the ground to position in a breath and her
demoniac quarter began to cry his signals almost before
the whistle had ceased! Pearsall was as nearly
demoralized as it had ever been her fortune to be
for several years.</p>

<p>Inside her thirty-yard line, according to all the
rules of the game, her defense should have strengthened
and the enemy’s attack slowed down. Yet
nothing of the sort happened. With Pearsall’s backs
close behind her line, well spread to repel end attacks,
Manning again did the improbable. Le Gette
fell back to kicking position and Tasker took his
place in the line. Pearsall believed no try-at-goal
would come on second down, and yet there was
no telling what such a crazy opponent would
do, and so the backs tried to be in two places
at once and were quite unprepared for the quick,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
short heave from Stuart to Muirgart. A Pearsall
back did almost spoil the pass since, scenting an end
run, he had sped out at the last instant, but Muirgart
pulled the ball down safely near the twenty-yard line
and reached the fourteen before the frantic Pearsall
back pulled him to earth.</p>

<p>The Blue called for time then, something she
might better have done minutes before, and making
no pretense of an injury to a player gathered in close
conclave near the goal. A substitute end was
whisked in from the Pearsall bench and was closely
watched by the enemy lest he divulge instructions
from his coach before the next play was over.
Stuart fumed at the two-minute delay but had to put
up with it. He and Jack bent and talked in panting
whispers. Back up the field, the Cherry-and-Gray
cohorts were chanting “<em>Touchdown! Touchdown!
Touchdown!</em>” From the opposite stand the Pearsall
contingent was equally clamorous with its slogan
“<em>Hold ’em Pearsall! Hold ’em Pearsall!</em>” Then
the whistle piped again.</p>

<p>It was first down, the ball a scant yard past
the fifteen and well to the left of the goal. Stuart,
dripping perspiration, his heart thumping hard,
reasoned that Pearsall would look for one of two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
things, a run around the left on the short side of the
field or an attack to the right to center the ball in case
a try-at-goal became necessary. What she would
doubtless least expect was a straight smash at the
left of the line. And so that is what Stuart called
for and that is what Tasker performed. A fullback
split-buck through left of center, with Tasker taking
the ball from Stuart at a hand pass, with Burns and
Littlefield charging to the right, with Brewton and
Beeman putting the opposing guard out and Cutts
heaving at the center, took the ball to the eight
yards. Pearsall was shouting hoarsely, frantically,
digging her cleats. The substitute end whispered
his order as Stuart yelped for action.</p>

<p>“Come on, Manning! Play fast! Get in there,
Thirsty! Signals!”</p>

<p>Again the ball went to Tasker, but this time a
scant yard rewarded an off-tackle play on the right.
Pearsall found encouragement and, when the stick
was seen to move but a few feet along the side-line,
a wild shout of acclaim arose from the blue-decked
stand.</p>

<p>“Third down!” shouted the referee. “About
three to go!”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it!” cried Stuart. “Hard, fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
<em>hard</em>! Here we go! Le Gette back! Signals!”</p>

<p>“Bust that up!” shrieked the Pearsall captain.
“Block that kick! Get through, Pearsall!”</p>

<p>“Watch for a fake!” shouted the Blue’s quarter
anxiously.</p>

<p>Back went the ball, but although Le Gette swung
his long leg, it was Billy Littlefield who snuggled the
pigskin to his stomach, put his head down and
dashed like a battering-ram into the line. Before
him went Burns, behind him Stuart and Le Gette.
Straight at the Pearsall right guard he dashed,
stopped with a grunt, dug his toes and went on
again. Shouts, grunts, wild confusion of sound
and movement, and then, suddenly, a wavering of
the Blue defense! The line buckled, gave! Then
the secondary defense piled in behind it, and the advance
paused, stopped. A whistle blew.</p>

<p>Littlefield, void of breath but grinning, was pulled
to his feet. “Fourth down! About half a yard to
go!” droned the referee.</p>

<p>“Let’s have it!” yelled Stuart hoarsely. “Kick
formation! Hold that line, Manning!” Stuart
trotted back to kicking position. “Signals!” Then
they came, and Cutts passed the ball back to Tasker
and the big fullback ran out to the left, Burns beside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
him, Littlefield behind. Then came Stuart’s frantic
“<em>In! In!</em>” and Tasker swerved to the right, Littlefield
sent a Pearsall tackle toppling out of the path
and, with the enemy all about him, yet, as though by
a miracle, eluding them, Howdy Tasker—Fame
beckoning him on—spun and twisted, dodged and
side-stepped and, finally, with half the Pearsall team
clutching and dragging, spurned the last line and
went over!</p>

<p>Almost before the whistle had blown Stuart was
sprinting toward the side line. “How much time is
there, sir?” he demanded breathlessly of the linesman.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve got seven minutes yet!” was the reply.</p>

<p>Seven minutes! Then they had scored in eight,
well under the coach’s allowance of ten! Stuart
swung his head guard in triumph as he hurried back.
Now if only he could kick the goal! Le Gette picked
up the ball and took it out to the twenty-yard line,
Stuart following, and slowly and cautiously lowered
himself to the ground. They were still cheering,
still shrieking back there on the Manning side, and
for an instant the sound worried Stuart. Then he
cast an anxious look at Le Gette. Save that that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
youth’s lungs were pumping hard, he showed no
sign of perturbation.</p>

<p>“This ought to be easy, Stuart,” panted Le Gette
reassuringly, as he pointed the ball.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Stuart. But there was a noticeable
lack of enthusiasm in that assent. He was wishing
with all his heart that he might exchange places with
the other. The old self doubt was back and he was
horribly afraid. Yet he instructed Le Gette with
apparent confidence, took a last look at the bar,
stepped forward and kicked. Then he closed his
eyes for an instant, not daring to watch the flight
of the ball, and opened them only when a mighty
cheer burst forth from the Manning stand!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<small>IN THE LAST QUARTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">No team could continue the pace that Manning
had set at the start, and when Cutts
had again kicked off from the midfield and
Pearsall had caught and reeled off twelve yards there
was a perceptible let-down in Manning’s speed, and,
since the Blue had in the interim between the scoring
and the kick-off pulled herself together, the opponents
appeared more closely matched. Pearsall
made her distance once, Connor carrying the ball
around Whaley when two tries at the left of center
had yielded five yards. The Blue’s fullback got two
through Le Gette, but after two more tries at the
line Pearsall punted to Stuart on his thirty-two.
He managed to dodge back for five before he was
thrown heavily.</p>

<p>Manning began then a systematic bucking of the
Pearsall center and obtained good results, Tasker
and Burns gaining between tackles for enough to
take the pigskin in the Blue’s territory. There an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
off-side penalty set her back and Littlefield was
caught off the line and dumped on his head. Stuart
punted to the Blue’s fourteen and Pearsall kicked on
second down to Manning’s forty. Manning failed to
make her distance on three tries and Tasker punted.
The kick was short and a Pearsall back landed the
ball on his thirty-two. A forward pass grounded,
but on the next play Connor again went around
Whaley and reached Manning’s forty-six. A
second attempt at the same play was spilled for a
loss and Pearsall sent her left half close off Thurston
for six. The quarter ended and the teams changed
fields.</p>

<p>Pearsall had regained her confidence and showed
it, and the Blue stand was shouting madly. Pearsall
brought off her first successful forward-pass and
made it go for nine yards, placing the ball close
to the home team’s thirty-yard line. Pearsall’s
quarterback got loose around his left and added four
more, and Coach Haynes hurried Wesner on in place
of Whaley. The Blue was playing desperately and
was hard to stop. Yet from the twenty-six her progress
was slower and it required the tape to determine
her right to retain possession of the ball on the
twenty. But she had made her distance by an inch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
or two, and the Pearsall supporters went mad with
joy. Almost on the threshold, the Blue became
cautious and, using a right shift, concentrated on the
enemy’s tackles. But two tries gained her only three
yards and Loring, her left half, went back to kicking
position. As was expected, the third down became
an attempt at a plunge through center, an
attempt that was spoiled by the Manning backs.
Then, from the twenty-three, Loring got the ball on
a good pass, dropped it and kicked. Manning broke
through, but, although Jack Brewton tipped the
pigskin with his fingers, the ball went squarely across
the bar and the Blue had scored.</p>

<p>The rest of the second period passed without further
scoring, although, with but two minutes to play,
Stuart, faking a pass to Tasker, hid the ball for an
instant and then shot straight through the enemy’s
center and dodged and squirmed through the backfield
for twenty-eight yards, landing the pigskin on
Pearsall’s twenty-nine. That sample of the quarterback’s
return to his old form brought the Manning
cheerers to their feet, and there they stayed, cheering
wildly, imploring a touchdown. But, although
Coach Haynes sped Hanson in for Littlefield and
Hanson and Lowe and Tasker each banged at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Pearsall line or plunged past tackle, three downs left
the Cherry-and-Gray three yards short of her distance
and Stuart and Jack held a consultation.
Stuart was all for risking a forward pass, but
Jack preferred playing it safer on a try at a field
goal.</p>

<p>“It had better be Le Gette, then,” Stuart panted.
“I’m all in, Jack. But he can do it.”</p>

<p>“All right! Let’s have it!”</p>

<p>Le Gette looked a little bit pale when he dropped
back to the twenty-eight. The distance was nothing
to bother him, nor was the angle extreme, but this
was his first attempt during the game and he was
nervous. And things went against him: Joe Cutts
passed high and Le Gette wasted a valuable moment
getting the ball to position: a Pearsall guard got
through between Beeman and Cutts and, although
Hanson spilled him, added to Le Gette’s worriment.
As a result the ball started well but, short of the
goal, veered from its path. There was a moment of
doubt that ended with a yell of relief from Pearsall.
The pigskin had passed a foot outside the further
upright! Le Gette looked as if he wanted to cry,
but Stuart said: “Hard luck, Steve! You’ll get
the next one!” and the teams lined up once more.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
Pearsall tried one smash at the foe and then the
whistle blew.</p>

<p>Manning and Pearsall sang and cheered all
through the intermission, Manning with the confidence
that a four-point lead gave her, Pearsall with
the hope of ultimate victory. When the teams
trotted back again all previous efforts in the line of
cheering were paled by the mighty welcomes that
burst forth from the stands. Pearsall had made but
one change in her line-up, Manning two. Codman
was at left guard in place of Beeman and Wheaton
was at quarter. Stuart saw the rest of the game
from the bench. He held no resentment toward Mr.
Haynes, for “Wheat” had proved his right to the
position and the coach had fulfilled his promise. If,
secretly, Stuart believed that he could have played
that second half better than his rival, he gave no
voice to the belief. He took what consolation he
could from the conviction that he had performed
well while he had been in and tried not to be unduly
troubled by the reflection that had he tried that goal
from field instead of Le Gette, Manning’s score
might now be three points bigger.</p>

<p>Pearsall came back for that third period at least
twenty per cent better. What had passed in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Blue’s quarters during half-time none but the
members of the team and their coach knew, but
whatever it was it had had its effect. Pearsall, with
her line-up practically unaltered, took command of
the situation at once. Manning gave the kick-off to
Pearsall and when the ball had landed in Muirgart’s
arms near his twenty-five-yard line she kept it but a
brief time. Three rushes proved the enemy’s line
too strong, and Tasker punted. Fate took a hand
then. That punt was high and short and was pulled
down on the fifty-yard line. From there Pearsall
opened up a new style of attack, placing her backs,
three-abreast, close to her line and keeping the plays
concealed most bewilderingly. She found a weak
spot at Codman and made gain after gain there until
Codman was replaced by Baker. She pulled off
two forward-passes that were as successful as they
were daring, using long heaves far down the field to
an unprotected end. Six minutes after the kick-off
the Blue was hammering at Manning’s portal and
the Cherry-and-Gray, desperate, was fighting for
those final ten yards.</p>

<p>Pearsall saw victory ahead and was not to be
denied. Amidst a continued welter of noise from
the stands, she hammered and banged, gaining two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
yards here, three there, making it first down at last
on Manning’s six. Irmo went in for Cutts, who
was showing wear, and the Manning center stood
steady. With four yards to go on fourth down,
Pearsall, faking a kick, sent Connor skimming
around the right end and, with sinking hearts, the
Cherry-and-Gray’s adherents saw him stagger across
the goal line at the corner of the field. From that
touchdown Loring sent over an easy goal, and on the
score-board the white numerals changed from 7 to 3
to 7 to 10!</p>

<p>But there still remained nearly twenty minutes of
playing time and, undaunted, Manning went back to
the contest. Pearsall for the rest of that period
seemed content to play on the defensive and punted
whenever the ball fell into her hands in her own
territory. Manning found the Blue line almost impregnable
and was forced to use all the tricks in her
bag to make her gains. But luck seemed against
her. Forward passes failed and end runs were as
often stopped behind the line as beyond it. Yet, by
hook or by crook, the Cherry-and-Gray managed to
make her distance four times before the whistle
ended the third period, though never once reaching
far into Pearsall territory. When the period ended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
the ball was Manning’s on her thirty-four yards,
following a punt by the enemy.</p>

<p>Stuart, watching anxiously from the bench,
squirmed time and again as the home team’s plays
failed to gain and the minutes sped past. There was
something psychological in Manning’s condition, and
Stuart recognized the fact, although he didn’t use
such a long word to describe it to himself. He
merely said: “That touchdown has taken the starch
right out of them!” It wasn’t that Manning didn’t
try hard, for she did. Her men were fairly working
themselves to death. But labor and skill, if ill
applied, fail of their purpose, and Manning was
somehow fighting blindly. Stuart recalled a movie
comedy he had seen wherein a man had tried
mightily to break through a door in a wall that ended
ten feet further along. The team, he thought, was
like that man. It was wasting its efforts trying to
get through what might better be got around or over.
It had tried to get around, to be sure, and it had tried
to get over as well, but it hadn’t tried the right way.
In running the ends it had been advertising the play
beforehand, starting the runner from well behind
the line and sweeping the interference along with
him. Why, the veriest idiot could have told what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
was coming! As for her forward passes, he could
find little fault with the execution of those. Sheer
luck had spoiled them, it seemed. But the team did
have a puzzling forward pass play which was well
disguised as a half back run, and that had not been
attempted. More than once he was moved to speak
his thoughts to Coach Haynes, but always something
held him back. After all, the Coach had eyes and
doubtless saw just what Stuart saw. Perhaps when
the fourth period began the Cherry-and-Gray team
would find itself again.</p>

<p>While the teams changed fields and water carriers
scampered to the side lines with pails and paper
cups, Coach Haynes turned from a conference with
The Laird and summoned Littlefield to him. A few
brief words were exchanged and Billy, throwing off
his blanket, ran on. No other change was made.
Yet when Manning had wasted one play on an ill-fated
attack at the Pearsall line on the left of center,
she suddenly changed her tactics, and Stuart, observing,
sighed his relief.</p>

<p>“Haynes has sent the right dope, I guess,” he confided
to Lowe, beside him. “Now maybe we’ll see
something.”</p>

<p>But Pearsall was not napping, and, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
Littlefield sneaked through between tackle and end
on the left, the gain was short. Another try outside
of end went better, but fourth down found them shy
three yards of the required ten, and Tasker booted.
This time, catching near her twenty-five, her quarterback
slammed to earth without gain by Muirgart,
Pearsall didn’t kick on first down, nor yet on second
or third. Instead, she began a hard drive on Manning’s
left wing, hitting Brewton and Baker for
short gains and then getting past Jack on the outside
for nearly the distance. A fake kick and a quick
slam at center gave her first down on her thirty-six.
From there the Blue, abandoning defensive tactics,
took the war into the enemy’s territory in just seven
plays. Muirgart gave place to Jakin at left end and
went limping off to the cheers of the Manning stand.
Pearsall worked a quarterback run for eight and
followed with a well-disguised forward-pass that
landed the ball on Manning’s thirty-two. There,
however, she hit a snag and, with a yard to go on
fourth down, saw her backs piled up with no gain.
Almost under the shadow of her goal, Manning took
no risk of losing the ball, but, after one futile plunge
at right tackle, punted.</p>

<p>Tasker got nearly fifty yards on that kick, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Manning supporters yelled their relief and delight.
Pearsall started back determinedly from her thirty-five,
gained four around Jakin, gained one at the
same end, made two through Irmo and again kicked.
Littlefield caught on his twenty-seven and swept the
ball back to the forty before he was stopped. Then
began another brave attempt to reach the distant
goal. Using C Formation, with the backs spread
widely, Manning fought her way across midfield and
started a determined march into the enemy country.
With Tasker back as though to punt, Littlefield and
Burns found gaps time and again and shot through
the line only to be brought to earth by the secondary
defense. Yet the short gains were consistent for
awhile, and the pigskin went nearer and nearer the
Blue’s goal. But the minutes were ticking themselves
off with fatal rapidity, and as, past the thirty-five,
the gains shortened, and, finally, Burns was
thrown for a loss, Stuart knew that there was to be
no victory for the home team to-day.</p>

<p>On the enemy’s thirty-two, with four to go on
fourth down, Wheaton tried a desperate expedient.
Given another five yards or so, he would be willing
to risk a try for a goal from the field, and so, sending
Le Gette back to kicking position and dropping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
to the ground as though to hold the ball for a place
kick, Wheaton called his signals. Pearsall, alarmed,
held herself ready to break through. Then the ball
sped back into Wheaton’s hands. But instead of
kicking it Le Gette only swung his foot past it, and
the next moment Wheaton was on his feet stepping
back, the pigskin poised for a throw. Then Jakin
signaled and the ball sped across the line. It was
a fine toss and a fine catch and although the left
end did not get free, he made the twenty-two yards
before he was smothered by the enemy.</p>

<p>The Manning stand saw victory waving, and
such a shout went up from the throats of her devoted
hundreds that even the wearied and jaded
players felt the thrill. Manning was racing with
Time now, for the linesman was slowly edging
nearer and nearer, his eyes constantly dropping to
the dial of the stop watch in his hand, and it seemed
that Time must win. The two-minute period had
already been announced, and more than twenty
yards remained between the Cherry-and-Gray and
a victory. Manning sprang quickly to position,
but not so quickly that the time she consumed did
not seem interminable to the anxious watchers.
Pearsall was less inclined to speed, but the opponent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
made her hustle. Littlefield tried hard to gain off
tackle on the right, but made less than two yards.
Next, what looked like the same play resolved itself
into another forward pass, but this time Wesner
failed to get into place and the pass grounded.
Then Fortune again turned her back on the Cherry-and-Gray
warriors. Tasker smashed through between
left guard and tackle for nearly five yards,
but the squawking of the horn spelled disaster and
the referee paced off five yards and put the ball
back close to the twenty-five-yard line. Jakin had
been caught off-side.</p>

<p>Stuart groaned aloud. Third down and thirteen
yards to go! And seconds instead of minutes left!
Would Wheaton waste any of that precious time on
a hopeless rush or would he call on Le Gette for a
field goal from about the thirty-three yards that
looked equally hopeless? All expectation of a victory
had been abandoned by the Manning supporters.
Instead, they prayed for a tie score, and, as the precious
seconds ticked themselves away, prayed
silently.</p>

<p>Yet that silence was broken before the whistle
blew again, for Towne was running on, and, behind
him, four more substitutes, and the Manning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
stand answered the cheer leaders’ demand for “A
short cheer for Towne!” for Leonard, for Thompson,
for Lowe, for Whiting! Cheers for those who
retired were cut short, for the whistle piped once
more, the referee scuttled to safety and a sigh of
relief burst from Stuart. Le Gette was walking
back!</p>

<p>“Twenty-four seconds!” some one was crying as
he took his stand. But that didn’t worry him.
The play once begun, time was of no account. It
was the distance and angle that caused him trepidation.
He was eight yards behind the line and the
line was close to the twenty-five; and the nearer goal
post was well to his left. Perhaps had he been
fresh, with his lungs not seemingly on the point of
stopping work and his heart not pounding like a
sledge, he might have faced his task with more confidence.
But as it was his spine felt more like a
column of water than a thing of bone and his muscles
were twitching.</p>

<p>On the stands a deep silence had fallen. Pearsall’s
cry of “<em>Block that kick!</em>” had dwindled away.
Even the shouts of the opposing players had lapsed to
hoarse mutters as Irmo, sighting, prepared to shoot
the ball back. Wheaton, crouched behind the center,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
yelped his signals in a voice that cracked.
Steve Le Gette held his trembling hands straight
out, stiffened himself on his wobbling legs. Then
came the thuds of meeting bodies, the rasping of
canvas against canvas, the wild, unintelligible cries,
the throaty grunts as Pearsall hurled herself at the
enemy. But came, too, the battered brown ball,
turning lazily over twice on its shorter axis and
settling true into the outstretched hands awaiting
it. One more brief glance at the crossbar, a quick
turning of the ball, a single step forward, a powerful
swing of a leg! Then forms blotted the speeding
ball from his sight. The enemy was all about him,
plunging past, toppling to the trampled sod.</p>

<p>Up and up, slowly, unconcernedly, went the ball,
hung for a moment against the blue of the sky and
arched downward. Midway between the posts it
sailed and, for a fleeting instant, as it began its descent,
it was eclipsed by the white streak of the
crossbar!</p>

<small>STUART SPEAKS HIS MIND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ten to ten!</p>

<p>A tied score and victory for neither
team!</p>

<p>When the outburst that acclaimed Le Gette’s goal
had finally died down a strange silence descended
over the stands. Near midfield the teams were
cheering each other, but the cheers sounded faint
and perfunctory. The groups broke up and the
players turned toward the benches and then, mingling
with the throng, hurried off the field. The
cheering section on the Manning side found its voice
and broke into measured sound; a long cheer for
the Team, a regular cheer for Pearsall—“and make
it good!”—and another long cheer for Manning.
The remnants of the Pearsall cheering section returned
the compliment, and then the stands emptied.</p>

<p>It was a very quiet throng that flowed over the
turf toward the campus. There is something woefully
flat about a tied football game, and speculation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
and argument as to what might have happened
bring small comfort. Many of the visitors felt
cheated because there had been no subsequent spectacle,
no snake dance with caps and brightly hued
megaphones tossing over the crossbars, no triumphant
cheering and singing. Some departed firm in
the conviction that that amusement should have been
provided for them irrespective of the game’s outcome!</p>

<p>In the gymnasium there was plenty of talk, but
it flowed levelly, with no crescendos. Many remarks
began with “If” and “But” and ended in
the air. The general atmosphere was one of resentment
rather than of regret, as though Fate had
played a sorry trick. Later on, perspective came
to the aid and a more philosophic mood prevailed,
but just now there were moody faces aplenty in the
locker room. Outside, the fellows were gathered
before the entrance responding faithfully to Stearns
Wilson’s every demand. Players and substitutes,
coaches and managers, trainer and assistants were
cheered loudly, but the sound, booming down to the
wearied warriors, failed to dispel their gloom.</p>

<p>At supper time the entrance of every football fellow
was, as usual, warmly applauded, and cheerfulness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
was more apparent. Stuart, coming in a few
minutes late, with Neil, was met with a salvo such
as had been accorded only Jack Brewton. Stuart,
drawing his chair out, looked back to see who had
followed him into the hall, and was surprised
to discover that the long-continued chorus of
“A-a-ay!” was in his honor. He felt an odd sense
of pleasant confusion and tried to hide it by drinking
from an empty water glass. A crowd that included
Stuart and Jack and Neil invaded the moving
picture house after supper and, finding a really
humorous comedy to laugh at, returned to school in
better spirits.</p>

<p>But in Stuart’s case the spirits didn’t outlast the
night, and when he awoke nearly an hour before
he needed to on Sunday morning and found the
world gray and soggy under a drizzling rain he
became horribly depressed. He couldn’t get to sleep
again, but lay listening to the patter of the drops on
the window ledge and faced a blank future. There
didn’t seem to be anything to get up for! Nothing
this morning nor any other morning! Life looked
frightfully drab and dull. No more football!
Nothing ahead but lessons! He groaned and pulled
a sheet over his head. Of course, he might go in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
for basketball. That was pretty good fun. Or
hockey. Either one would at least keep him in
training. But for what? More basketball or
hockey! Just now he was in a martyrlike mood
and told himself that he’d never try football again;
anyhow, not at Manning. He had made a dismal
failure of it and self-respect at least forbade his
going back to it. They’d elect Howdy Tasker captain
next Saturday evening, probably. Well,
Howdy was all right, but he had had enough of
working under some one else. And Haynes would
be coaching again, he supposed. Well, Haynes had
been pretty decent lately, he’d say that, but if he
went back to the team next year there’d be the same
old rows! No, he was through with football;
plumb, everlastingly through!</p>

<p>Neil awoke with a prodigious yawn and a backward
stretch that knocked his knuckles resoundingly
against the wall. Neil always awoke that way.
Then he sat up and, as Stuart thrust the sheets from
his face, blinked across smilingly. “Hello,” he
said. “What time is it?”</p>

<p>“About a quarter to eight,” answered Stuart morosely.
“Go to sleep again.”</p>

<p>“I’m slept out. Gee, it’s raining, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>“No, some fellow’s cleaning his teeth out the
window,” said Stuart sarcastically. Neil brushed
the remaining sleep from his eyes and studied his
roommate for a moment in silence. Then:</p>

<p>“Whence the grouch, son?” he asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the good?” asked the other vaguely.
“Nothing to look forward to now but just a lot of
beastly studying!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Christmas vacation’s only a month
away!”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” acknowledged Stuart grudgingly.
Then, with triumphant pessimism: “And after vacation
come exams!”</p>

<p>Neil laughed. “I guess you’re beyond human aid
this morning! Been awake long?”</p>

<p>“Half an hour, I suppose. I’ve been thinking.”</p>

<p>“That explains it. Thinking always did have a
bad effect on you, Stuart. What have you been
thinking about?”</p>

<p>“Lots of things. About football, for one. I’m
going to quit.”</p>

<p>“Why not? The season’s over.”</p>

<p>Stuart scowled. “I mean for good. I’m
through.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>Neil digested that startling information a moment.
Then he asked carelessly: “Did it ever occur
to you that you might be elected captain again?”</p>

<p>“<em>Me?</em>” Stuart stared across incredulously.
“You’re crazy! Not a chance! Anyhow, I
wouldn’t accept!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you? Why?”</p>

<p>“You know why,” replied Stuart shortly. “After
what happened this year, do you think I’d—I’d——
Anyway, they wouldn’t want me for captain. And
I don’t blame ’em. It’ll be Howdy, I guess. He’ll
make a good one, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think he would,” agreed Neil. But there
was a suggestion of reservation in his tone that
caused Stuart to view him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he charged, “for the love of Mike,
don’t go around making cracks like that, Neil!”</p>

<p>“Like what?” asked the other innocently.</p>

<p>“Why, about me being captain next year! Think
I want fellows to think that—that I’m looking for
it—or would take it if it was offered? Well, by
golly, I don’t! That would be the limit!”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t mention it. Suppose, though,
some one else suggested it? Want me to say officially
that you’d refuse?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I do! You say it as officially as you know
how. But I guess no one but you would ever think
of it, you crazy coot!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that,” replied Neil. “Let’s get up
and have a good shower before the gang takes possession.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any shower,” grumbled Stuart.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he followed Neil out of bed and
down the hall, and presently he might have been
heard whistling a football tune quite cheerfully
above the hiss of the water.</p>

<p>After breakfast, at which meal he consumed
rather more food than for many weeks past, the
feeling of depression took possession of him once
more, and it was not until the sermon was nearly
finished that a possible explanation came to him.
The explanation held just six letters: H-a-y-n-e-s!
His thoughts went back to a conversation held long
before in the coach’s room, especially to the closing
words of that conversation. “When the season’s
over I’m going to give myself the satisfaction
of telling you just what I think of you!” “When
the season’s over I’ll be ready to hear it!” Stuart,
remembering, squirmed in his seat. The season
was over and the time had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>Stuart didn’t hear any more of the sermon, if he
had heard any before.</p>

<p>When dinner was done and he and Neil were
back in the room he mooned restlessly around for
awhile and then took up his cap. “I’m going out
for a bit,” he explained carelessly.</p>

<p>“Want me to come along?” asked Neil, looking
up from the letter he was writing.</p>

<p>“No, don’t bother,” answered Stuart hurriedly.
“I won’t be long. I—I’ll just mosey around.
Maybe walk over to the village or somewhere.
Back soon.”</p>

<p>Neil nodded. “Better take an umbrella. It’s
pouring now.”</p>

<p>But Stuart chose a raincoat instead and took himself
off, leaving Neil to gaze reflectively at the
closed door and tap the end of his pen thoughtfully
against his teeth.</p>

<p>Stuart wasn’t sure that Mr. Haynes was in town.
He might, for all he knew, have hurried off home
by this time. If he had done so, Stuart would be
a whole lot relieved. At least, that’s what he told
himself, only to retract it a minute later. He had
something to say to the coach, something that had
to be said sooner or later, and it would be a heap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
better to say it now and get it off his chest!</p>

<p>Mr. Haynes answered the door himself when
Stuart had rung, Mr. Haynes in a faded blue dressing
gown and slippers, a section of a morning paper
in his hand. He didn’t seem at all surprised to find
Stuart on the threshold, a fact proved by his greeting.
“Hello, Harven,” he said cordially. “Come
in. Throw your coat over the chair there.
Rather a wet day, isn’t it? I expected you’d be
over.”</p>

<p>Stuart preceded his host into the dim study and
took one of the two chairs drawn close to the long
windows. The little park before the house was
dismal and sodden to-day. Mr. Haynes plowed
his way through a litter of papers and sank into the
opposite chair rescuing his pipe from the ash tray
and reaching for his pouch.</p>

<p>“The Courant has a pretty good story of the
game,” he said as he filled the bowl. “Have you
read it?” Stuart nodded. “Gives you a lot of
credit, Harven, but no more than you deserve.
The way you drove the team in the first quarter was
as nice a thing as I ever saw. I dare say you’ve
wondered why I didn’t put you back in the second
half, Harven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir, I haven’t. You said it would be
Wheaton.”</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “Yes, I said that, but after
your showing—” He paused and lighted his pipe.
“I’m going to be honest. You ought to have gone
back, Harven. I believe now that if you had gone
back we might have won. I made a mistake. You
see, Wheaton had worked mighty hard, fairly
sweated for us for weeks, and I thought he deserved
his reward. It doesn’t do, though, if you’re a
coach, to let sentiment get at you. I ought to have
known better. Well, it’s too late now. Of course,
we might not have won, even if you had been in,
but I shall always be bothered by the possibility.
We put up a good game, though, and in several
ways showed up better than Pearsall. For one
thing, we were in better condition. And we have
more ground gained to our credit. On the whole,
Harven, we haven’t any cause to be sore over that
game. We faced a good team, a better team than
I’d suspected, and if we didn’t outplay them we came
mighty close to doing it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Stuart studied his hands a moment.
Then, “When it comes to placing the blame for losing—for
not winning, though—” he went on, “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
guess I’ve got a good deal to do with that, Mr.
Haynes. I guess if I hadn’t acted crazy and made
things harder for you and thrown up my job—not
that Jack wasn’t a mighty good captain, though: I
don’t mean that, sir! But if things had gone
smoother at the first——”</p>

<p>“I know, Harven. Between us we sort of
botched the business, didn’t we? It wasn’t altogether
your fault. Knowing you as I do now, I
see that I was half to blame. I got a wrong impression
of you when I took hold here. My mistake
was in not trying to make a friend of you first
of all. You didn’t give me much encouragement,
but I should have tried. You see, Harven, I’ve
learned since then that you are hard to drive but
easily led. And you’re loyal. I tried to drive you.
That was my first mistake, and maybe my biggest.
I should have set out to win your friendship. I
might not have succeeded, of course, but I should
have tried.”</p>

<p>“I—I guess you would have,” muttered Stuart.</p>

<p>“Succeeded?” Mr. Haynes smiled. “Hang it,
Harven, I almost believe I could have! Anyway, I
like to think so.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, there’s no reason for you to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
any of the blame, Mr. Haynes,” said Stuart. “I
thought I knew it all, and I didn’t. The fellows
oughtn’t to have made me captain. I didn’t have
the head for it. That’s been proved twice
over. I showed rotten judgment lots of times.
It was a good thing for the team that I was
chucked.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t chucked,” said the coach earnestly.
“No one—I, least of all—wanted you to resign.
That letter to you was badly conceived and badly
written. All any one wanted was to get things running
smoothly, but the Committee went about it the
wrong way. When you offered your resignation I
protested against its acceptance. So did Wilson and
McColl. But the majority of the Committee were
against us. The majority had put themselves in a
hole, and rather than crawl out they pulled the hole
in on top of ’em. I felt all along that if you and I
could pull together we could go a long way, Harven,
but I didn’t know how to manage you. Well, all
that’s ancient history now. There were mistakes
made on both sides, mistakes that aren’t likely to
be made again, I guess. Because, Harven, you’ve
got good sense and you’re fair, and you know that
I was right about the two things that caused the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
most friction between us. I mean the abolishment
of training table and the injustice of barring Le
Gette from the team because of something he had
done to offend you personally. I made plenty of
mistakes, but on those two things I was right. Isn’t
that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Stuart honestly. “The
fellows were in better shape this year than they
were last. There wasn’t any slump this year, and
last year there was. And about Le Gette, why,
he—I found out just the other day that he didn’t
do what I thought he did.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” replied the coach heartily.
“And even if he had, Harven, I still would have
been right in not sacrificing him to your personal
animosity. Don’t you agree with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! I’m not ‘rubbing it in,’ Harven. I’m
not always right in my premises and judgments,
any more than any one else is, but I wanted to know
that you recognized that in those things I was right
and that you were fair enough and frank enough
to say so. Because if it should happen that we
were to work together again next fall it would make
it easier for both of us. Perhaps I haven’t expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
myself very clearly, but I guess you get
what I’m driving at.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But I don’t believe I’ll be playing next
year.”</p>

<p>“What? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Stuart vaguely.</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly hope you will. If I came back
I’d surely need you.”</p>

<p>“But you <em>are</em> coming, aren’t you, sir?” asked
Stuart.</p>

<p>“I can’t say. You see, I was engaged for this
season only. Although it wasn’t set down in the
contract, it was naturally understood that a renewal
of the contract depended on my success with the
team this fall. Well, I don’t know how the Committee
on Athletics view the result. In some ways
we had a good season. We won five games, lost
two and tied one. We got through without injuries
worth speaking of, although the credit for that isn’t
mine. If we had won yesterday’s game I might
fairly claim success. Between you and me, I still
claim it. But the Committee may not look at it
as I do. Results are what count, Harven, and
there’s no getting around the fact that we didn’t
win our big game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! But we didn’t lose it, either, sir. That
ought to mean something, I’d say. Besides, I guess
all the fellows think that you did mighty well. I
do, anyway. I thought, of course, you were coming
back.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall,” replied the coach, smiling.</p>

<p>“Not that you’d care much, I suppose,” added
Stuart. “I guess you wouldn’t have much trouble
finding a job!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but it doesn’t do a coach any good
to change too often. I’ve been at it four seasons
and this is my third place. That doesn’t sound
very well, does it? I was at Erskine College the
year after I graduated and then I went to Fisherville
and stayed two. I left there because Manning
offered me more money, and I needed it. I don’t
expect to spend my life as a football coach, Harven,
but while I’m at it I want to do the best I can.
I’ve got a sort of a law practice back home, but
it’s only the start of one, and I can’t afford to depend
on it yet. You see, there’s a family at home,
too, and they have to live.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t know you were married, sir!”</p>

<p>“I’m not. The family consists of my mother and
two sisters, unmarried. One of my sisters looks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
after the office while I’m away, but there isn’t much
to do, unfortunately. My town’s a smallish one
and there are two lawyers already established there.
It’s slow work to build a practice, Harven, in a place
like that.”</p>

<p>“I should think it would be,” mused Stuart. “I
think I’d rather coach football than be a lawyer,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t lead very far, though. I hope that
I’ll be in a position to drop it after another two
years. Meanwhile, I’d rather stay here than look
for a new place. Next year ought to see a whale
of a team here. Look at the material we’ll have:
you and Hanson and Thurston and Burns and
Tasker—no end of good players. Why, we can
start with practically a veteran team! And we’ve
laid a good foundation this fall, Harven: we’ve got
a system at work. Whoever has the job of coaching
next fall will have a cinch!”</p>

<p>“You bet! We’ve got some corking second-string
fellows, too, Mr. Haynes: Lowe and Leonard
and—and Thompson—”</p>

<p>“And Irmo. He has the making of a fine center.
And we’d be pretty well fixed for guards with Beeman
and Le Gette. Le Gette played a fine game<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
yesterday. And if it hadn’t been for his field goal
we’d have lost. I want you to know, Harven, that
I certainly appreciate the work you did with Le
Gette. I don’t believe another chap on the squad
could have taught him what you did in that short
time.”</p>

<p>“He was a mighty good learner,” said Stuart
warmly. “You simply couldn’t tire him! Lots of
times I’d want to quit and he’d keep me at it. With
Le Gette kicking field goals next year we’d ought
to be pretty well fixed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’m hoping you’ll share that duty with
him,” said the coach.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” murmured Stuart. “If
you don’t come back——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and felt the blood creeping
into his cheeks and, to hide his hideous embarrassment,
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“I must be getting back,” he said. “Neil will
think I’m lost or—or something!”</p>

<p>“Must you? Well, I’m glad you dropped in.
Do it again before I go, won’t you? I’m sticking
around until the last of the week. Oh, by the way,”
he continued as they shook hands, “wasn’t there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
something you wanted to say to me after the season
was over?”</p>

<p>Stuart caught the kindly quizzical gleam in the
other’s eyes and grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I’ve said it,” he muttered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<small>“FOR THE GOOD OF THE TEAM”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The football banquet and election was held
the Saturday after the Pearsall game,
as was the established custom. Coach
Haynes, urged to remain for it, did so, and sat at
the head of a long table in the upstairs parlor of the
village hotel, for the occasion transformed into a
banquet hall and hung with cherry-and-gray streamers
and flags. All players who had taken part in
the Pearsall or Brown games were on hand, as were
Mr. Pierson, chairman of the Committee on
Athletics, the manager and Assistant manager and
The Laird. In all, twenty-six persons sat down to
the feast, and good-fellowship and jollity held sway
from oysters to ices. Mr. Pierson spoke and Mr.
Haynes spoke and—well, about half of the number
said their say before the feast was over. Even The
Laird was lifted to his feet and compelled to say
something; and it is only fair to add that The Laird,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
although slow at the start, did extremely well once
he had forgotten his embarrassment, and had the
whole company convulsed. And, of course, there
was singing, a whole lot of singing that, no matter
if it wasn’t beyond criticism, sounded mighty well
down below on the sidewalk where, after the movie
theater had closed its doors, a half-hundred Manning
fellows stood and waited to learn the result of
the election. There was a well-defined rumor to
the effect that the election was “fixed,” but rumors
are not always correct. In any case, the rumor
produced no expressions of indignation.</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past ten when Mr. Pierson took
his leave, pursued down the stairs by the vocal assurance
that he was a jolly good fellow. Mr.
Haynes, too, would have left then, but by unanimous—and
extremely loud—protest was induced to
keep his place. The Laird always had witnessed the
elections and so he simply drew a chair to a window
and stuffed his pipe with evil-smelling tobacco. It
was Jack who rapped for order with the lid of a
sugar bowl and announced that nominations for
the captaincy were in order.</p>

<p>Wally Towne and Harry Leonard found their
feet simultaneously and, although Leonard was both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
nearer and larger than the other, Jack looked right
past him and gravely said: “The Member from the
Hospital has the floor!”</p>

<p>“It gives me great pleasure,” announced Towne
when the laughter had subsided, “and—er—does me
much honor to place before you the name of one
whose right to the captaincy of the team is incontestable.
It would be a waste of time for me to set
forth this gentleman’s qualities, because you all
know them as well as I do. Fellows, I nominate
Stuart Harven!”</p>

<p>There was a din of clapping and cheers. Stuart,
struck dumb by surprise, stared incredulously at the
speaker. Then he was on his feet. “Fellows!
Mr. Chairman!” But others were before him,
several others, and Jack, glancing mockingly at
Stuart, recognized Tasker. Tom Muirgart, at
Stuart’s left, pulled him forcibly back into his chair.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” he said sternly. “You’re out of
order!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want—I won’t accept——” stammered
Stuart.</p>

<p>“Order!” called Jack, thumping vigorously with
the sugar bowl lid. “Mr. Tasker has the floor.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, and fellows,” began Howdy, “in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
seconding the nomination of Harven I’d like to say
a few words.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Howdy!”</p>

<p>“Who’s stopping you?”</p>

<p>“You tell ’em, Old Timer!”</p>

<p>“Towne says it would be wasting time to say
anything about the nominee, but I don’t agree with
him. I’ll say there’s a lot to say about him. I’ll
say——”</p>

<p>“Take a fresh hold, Howdy!”</p>

<p>“I’ll say—” Howdy gulped and started over.
“Look what happened this fall. We elected Harven
captain and he got out. I don’t pretend to
know all the facts, but I do know that there were
mistakes made. Whether Harven made them or
the Ath. Fac. or Coach Haynes doesn’t matter.
Maybe they all made ’em. Anyway, it’s all over
and past now. But what I want to say is this.
There aren’t many of us would have acted better
than Stuart Harven did under the circumstances.
He didn’t sit down and sulk. He saw that he was
needed on the team and he walked right back and—and
enlisted as a private! And he worked hard
and he made good. Every fellow who played during
those first ten minutes of the Pearsall game<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
knows that he did. I haven’t got my breath yet!
He mighty near drove us off our feet, but we liked
it and loved him for it and—and, by gosh, we got
there! If I never play football again I’ve had my
money’s worth, fellows! And if I play twenty
years I’ll always remember that touchdown and be
proud that I had a hand in it! Now, I’ll say that
a fellow who can handle the team like that, and—and
who is the sportsman that Harven is, why, I’ll
say—I’ll say——”</p>

<p>But Tasker didn’t have to say any more, for the
cheers drowned his voice, and after moving his lips
a moment longer he sat down. Half a dozen others
demanded recognition, among them the frantic
Leonard, and Billy Littlefield was the fortunate
one.</p>

<p>“I’d like to say—if I can make myself heard—that
I second the nomination of Harven, and I move
that we cut out the red tape and declare him
unanimously elected!”</p>

<p>“Seconded!” “Atta boy! Let’s call it a day!”
“Harven!”</p>

<p>Jack rapped strenuously. “We’ll have to do this
in order,” he announced. “Are there any further
nominations?” He looked inquiringly at Leonard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
but Leonard, into whose ear Leo Burns was talking
emphatically, made no move. Jack whanged the lid
down. “We’ll proceed to ballot,” he said gravely.
“Gentlemen, is it your pleasure——”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” That was Stuart. In spite of the
efforts of Muirgart and Thurston, beside him, he
managed to get to his feet. “I’m—I—It’s mighty
good of you fellows, and I appreciate it, but I can’t
accept. I mean it. I’ll work hard next year and
do all I know how, but you’ve got to elect some other
chap. I had my whack at being captain, and I made
a mess of it, and I’m through. Any one of you
will do better than I could. I nominate Howard
Tasker. He——”</p>

<p>“You’re out of order, Mr. Harven,” said Jack
sternly. “The nominations are closed!”</p>

<p>“All right, but——”</p>

<p>Jack pounded vigorously, and Stuart, still protesting,
was yanked back into his chair.</p>

<p>“I move that a standing vote be taken, Mr. Chairman!”
called Littlefield. Several seconds were
heard.</p>

<p>“Moved and seconded,” droned Jack, “um-um-those
in favor-um-contrary minded-um-um-carried!
Are you ready for the vote? Those in favor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
the election of Stuart Harven to the captaincy will
rise and remain standing while——”</p>

<p>Every one save Stuart was on his feet in the instant,
cheering, and the balance of Jack’s oration
was lost. Even Coach Haynes found himself
standing, and, smiling apologetically, sat down
again. Leonard, who had entertained the mistaken
idea of nominating Hanson, was shouting as loud as
any. Jack’s announcement of the result wasn’t
heard beyond the sugar bowl whose lid he was rapidly
pounding out of shape. Tom Muirgart, grinning,
rumpled Stuart’s hair.</p>

<p>“You’re elected, son!” he chuckled. “Get up and
make a speech!”</p>

<p>Stuart swallowed hard, grinned in a sickly fashion
and shook his head. “All right,” he muttered.
“But—but it was a put-up job, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Sure it was!” roared Tom. “It was all fixed.
Neil Orr warned us that you’d refuse, and so we
had to——”</p>

<p>“Speech!” “Get up there, Cap!” “Speech,
Harven!” “Shoot, son!”</p>

<p>Stuart arose, more embarrassed than he could
remember ever having been in his life. Comparative
silence had been restored and two dozen faces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
were fixed expectantly on him. But the faces all
expressed liking and good will and Stuart found
courage.</p>

<p>“I meant what I said, fellows, but it didn’t seem
to make much difference. So—well, I accept.”</p>

<p>“You bet you do!” agreed Jack from the end of
the board. “You’re elected!”</p>

<p>“All right, but—you’d have done a heap better if
you’d selected some one else. Just the same, I
thank you, and—and I’ll do my best; and it will be
a better best than last time! I made a lot of mistakes,
but I’m not going to make them again. Next
year things will go a heap better, and if we don’t
lick Pearsall to a stiff froth I—I’ll eat my hat!”</p>

<p>Enthusiastic applause greeted that prophecy.
When he could make himself heard again Stuart
continued. “There’s something else I want to speak
about, fellows. We’ve just got to have Mr. Haynes
back next year. You don’t need me to tell you that.
But I understand that the Committee on Athletics
may not be satisfied with his work because we didn’t
lick Pearsall. That’s poppycock. It wasn’t his
fault. Every fellow here knows that we had a far
better team this fall than last. We were in better
physical shape and we knew more football. Now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
it seems to me that it would be a mighty good plan
to let the Ath. Fac. know how we feel about Mr.
Haynes, let them know that we want him back next
year; yes, and the year after that! I propose that
we get up a petition and sign it all around and hand
it in. It ought to have some weight with them,
and as I understand that they are to make a decision
the first of next week, the sooner we do it the
better. That’s all, I guess. Except that I thank
you fellows again for the honor you have done me.”</p>

<p>Stuart sat down again while the table cheered
long and heartily. Thurston sprang to his feet, but,
seeing that Mr. Haynes was also standing, seated
himself again. “After you, Coach,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Mr. Haynes. “I only want
to say that I appreciate Harven’s words. I feel
very proud and, at the same time, rather humble.
How well I’ve succeeded this season is for you to
judge, but I am conscious of having tried hard, and,
while I made mistakes, I have learned by them. To
know that I have retained your liking and that you
still have faith in me is—well, it makes me feel
pretty good. I congratulate you on the choice you
have made, for, no matter what he says, I know that
Stuart Harven is the man for the job. We’ve had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
our differences of opinion, he and I, but we’ve got
over them. What he says about another year I subscribe
to heartily, fellows, and if he has to eat his
hat I’ll help him! I’ll be right on hand to do it because
the Committee on Athletics very kindly offered
me a contract for two years more this afternoon
and I signed it!”</p>

<p>Pandemonium reigned supreme then. Billy Littlefield
started “For he’s a jolly good fellow” and
every one joined. The beauty of that song is that
you don’t have to know many words and you can
keep on singing it as long as your voice will hold
out. In the end, however, it changed to the school
song, and while that was still in progress some one
started downstairs and the others followed and, still
singing, the party made its way out to the sidewalk,
where, the news announced, cheers drowned the
song.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Stuart found himself walking
back to school with Jack’s arm linked in his.
Before and behind were others, laughing, singing,
sometimes cheering, but at the campus the throng
separated into smaller units and ultimately Stuart
and Jack found themselves alone in front of
Lacey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>“Come on up for a minute,” urged Stuart.</p>

<p>“Pretty late, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it doesn’t matter to-night. I shan’t
get to sleep for hours, and—I want to talk things
over.”</p>

<p>So they made their way through the silent corridors
to Number 12, to find Neil still up and
dressed, an expectant grin on his face. Stuart
shied his cap at him. “I’ll bet you had a hand in
it,” he charged. “That villainous grin gives you
away, old son!”</p>

<p>“Not guilty!” Neil laughed. “I told every one
you wouldn’t accept, didn’t I, Jack?”</p>

<p>“You did, Neil, you certainly did,” assented Jack
gravely.</p>

<p>Stuart grunted. “Huh, a lot of attention you
fellows paid to him, I’ll say!”</p>

<p>Jack grinned. “We certainly did. We stuffed
the ballot box, old son. We saw that it wouldn’t
be any use to tender the captaincy to you, so we
stuffed it down your silly throat!”</p>

<p>Stuart’s pretended indignation faded to a smile
as he sat himself on the window seat and took one
knee into his hands. Jack perched beside him and
Neil swung his chair around to face them after he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
had turned down the light halfway. “Who started
it, Jack?” asked Stuart.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, really. Nobody, I guess. That
is, it seemed to be sort of taken for granted all
around that you were to have it. The only—only
conspiracy was to-night before dinner. Then we
sort of fixed to railroad the election through. You
weren’t to have any chance to refuse it, or, if you
did kick up your heels, we weren’t to pay any attention
to you. Of course, everything was strictly
according to Hoyle——”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was!” jeered Stuart. “Suppose I didn’t
see how you refused to recognize Harry Leonard?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack, “Leonard was only delaying
traffic. He had a fool notion that Tom Hanson
wanted the election.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Who, Tom? I don’t believe so. Anyhow, he
hadn’t a chance, and it was an act of simple kindness
to keep him from making a show of himself.
Besides, I did give Leonard a chance to speak his
little piece, and he wouldn’t.” Jack grinned.
“That was after I’d seen Leo talking to him.
Maybe Leo showed him the futility of—er—his
course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>Stuart grunted again, and Neil said wistfully:
“I wish I’d been there!”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence in the dim room Stuart
said thoughtfully: “Well, there wasn’t anything
to do but accept, but—but I don’t see yet why they
did it. After the failure I made of it this time,
and all!”</p>

<p>“They did it for just one thing, Stuart,” replied
Jack earnestly. Stuart looked the question. “They
did it for the good of the team.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The talk died away and each of the three boys
sat there in the half-darkness and thought his own
thoughts. Stuart’s excitement had given place to a
feeling of contentment and well-being and good
will. His thoughts passed over his school life, and,
while he saw very clearly the many mistakes he had
made, he was not disturbed. Wasn’t it Mr. Moffit
who had said that one learned by mistakes? Well,
he had learned, he told himself, and whatever the
mistakes of the future might be, they’d not be the
old ones. Thinking forward, he made many good
resolutions, most of which, it is only fair to say,
he kept. A yawn from Jack broke the long silence.</p>

<p>“I was almost asleep,” he said. “You night owls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
can stay up if you like, but I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t break up the party,” begged Stuart plaintively.
“Say, I wish you were going to be here
next year, Jack. I’ll miss you, you old coot.”</p>

<p>“Thanks; same to you. I guess, though, you’ll
be much too busy to miss any one, old son. You’ll
have a football team to look after, and, speaking
from brief experience, I’ll say that’s a man-sized
job! Stuart, if you don’t beat Pearsall next year
I’ll come back and lick you!”</p>

<p>“You’re permitted to come back and <em>try</em>!”</p>

<p>“Huh! Well, just you see that I don’t have to.
Here’s Neil to look after, too. Don’t forget that.
That’ll keep you busy, you know; he’s always
getting into trouble.”</p>

<p>Stuart failed to note the twinkle in Jack’s eyes.
He looked across at his roommate and nodded
gravely.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” he assented. “Some one’s got to
look after old Neil.”</p>
